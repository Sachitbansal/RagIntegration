Once they found a box full of gold coins. Both of them left for home to share the money equally. They buried the box under a tree at the end of the village and went home because everyone would be suspicious if they took the box full of gold coins into the village. Did they become so rich if they went into the village with a box containing gold coins? They thought that the villagers would be jealous, so they came there at night and wanted to share equally.",

One night Uri finally went, dug the ground and brought a box containing gold coins and hid it in his house. As the days passed Pawan went to Ravi saying let\u2019s take the box of gold coins from the tree and said \u201cFriend! Let\u2019s get the box of gold coins buried under the tree at the end of the village.\u201d Both friends went to the end of the village and dug where they had buried it. But there was no box of gold coins. When the box of gold coins was not found, Pawan turned around. (Cheater Long Story in English with Moral)",

Not even a third person knows what is buried here except you and me. Give me my share politely. Or the King will complain about you.\u201d Pawan blamed Ravi and threatened him. Then Ravi said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what a box of gold coins is, I\u2019m telling you the truth, there is nothing I can do. Do as you like, God is there for everything.\u201d",

Everyone in the assembly was surprised that the tree was testifying to Pawan\u2019s words. King said that they will investigate tomorrow. Pawan went home and said to his father, \u201cFather! I stole the gold coins myself. If you do as I say, Ravi will be punished and the gold coins will be ours. We can live comfortably with them. The tree is tall enough to hold a man. In it you have to sit secretly without anyone knowing. When questioned by King tomorrow, he should say that Ravi stole the box of gold coins and Pawan knows nothing,\u201d Pawan said.
