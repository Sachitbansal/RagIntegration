Author’s Note
My grandmother, Krishnaa, popularly known as Krishtakka, was very bright
and affectionate. She was also a great storyteller. She never gave us any
sermons but taught the values of life through her stories. Those stories and
values remain with me even now. I spent my childhood carefree, stress-free,
with my cousins and grandparents at my hometown Shiggaon, a sleepy town
in north Karnataka. We shared everything there, whatever we had, and that
became a great bond among us cousins. The binding force was my
grandmother.
I made some changes when I wrote the stories in this book but mostly it is a
true reflection of my childhood.
When my granddaughter Krishnaa was born, she elevated me to the
position of grandmother. I realized more than ever the importance of stories,
and how much they help children to learn. Hence this book.
I hope, with these stories, children and parents will understand the unique
relationship between three generations and will continue to create bonds of
love with one another and the older generations in their families.
I would like to thank Penguin Books India, who are always eager to publish
my work. I would also like to thank Sudeshna Shome Ghosh, who became a
good friend apart from being my editor, in my journey of writing, in the last
decade.

To Krishnaa, who has taken me back to my 
childhood memories, from Sudha Ajji

The Beginning of the Stories
Summer holidays! Ajji smiled to herself as she waited for two more of her
grandchildren to arrive. Raghu and Meenu would be here soon. Anand and
Krishna had already arrived with their mother the previous evening. They had
been waiting restlessly for their cousins to arrive ever since. Even though Ajji
told them Raghu and Meenu would be here the next morning, these two kids
just would not listen. They went to the railway station with their grandfather,
Ajja, to receive them. The train must have pulled into the tiny railway station
of Shiggaon by now, and their grandfather would have hired a taxi to bring
them home along with their mother and the stacks of luggage.
Ajji hurried through her bath. She had finished cooking their favourite
dishes, and was now wearing a nice, soft cotton sari before going to the
veranda to wait for them.
There! There they came! What a noise the children were making! They all
nearly tumbled out of the car and came leaping and shouting to her, each
wanting to be the first to be hugged by her. Each one wanted to be closest to
Ajji.
Soon the children settled down. A visit to Ajji and Ajja’s house meant first
inspecting the garden to see how much the plants had grown since they last
came. Then they went to check on the cows, calves, dog, pups, cats and
kittens. Then they all ate huge quantities of Ajji’s delicious food. Finally,
while their mothers went off to chat and rest, the children gathered around
their grandmother for the best part of the holidays—listening to her wonderful
stories, particularly in the late afternoon.
Let us, too, gather under the fast revolving fan, on a mat on the floor,
fighting to be nearest to her, and listen in.


‘Doctor, Doctor’
The first day, the children asked, ‘Ajji, how do you know so many stories?’
Ajji smiled and answered, ‘My grandmother told me many stories. Some I
read in books. A few I learnt from youngsters like you, and the rest from your
Ajja.’ Then Ajji paused and said, ‘I see all of you have grown a lot since the
last time I saw you. So before I start telling any stories, I want to know what
each of you want to be when you grow up.’
Raghu, who was eleven years old, and the oldest of all, said immediately, ‘I
want to be an environment scientist.’ Meenu, who was nine, said, ‘I have not
decided, maybe a computer person like my dad.’ Anand, who was ten, said, ‘I
want to be an astronaut,’ and his twin sister Krishna firmly said, ‘I want to
become a fashion designer.’ Ajji smiled. ‘I am glad all of you have thought
about this. We should always have some aim in life which we must try to
achieve while being of help to others. Now let me tell you a story of a person
who learnt just such a lesson.’
Shall we, too, join Ajji and her gang of young friends and hear the story?
On a blazing hot summer afternoon, an old man came walking down a narrow
village path. He was tired and thirsty. Right by the road, he spotted a tiny
grocery store. It had a tin roof and mud walls. The shopkeeper sat inside
fanning himself and shooing away the flies that were buzzing around in the
stifling heat. There was a little bench in front of the store where the villagers
met when evening came and the land had cooled down. The old man flopped

down on the bench. He was so tired that for a while he could not speak.
Finally, he opened his mouth and uttered one word, ‘Water!’


Now, this village had been facing a horrible problem for a long time. It was
near a great desert and the rains came only once a year to fill its ponds and
wells. But the rains had disappeared for the last two years, and the villagers
had been making do with water from a faraway stream. Every morning groups
of men and women walked a long distance, filled their pots from the little
stream and used that the whole day. Naturally, no one wanted to waste even a
drop of this precious water.
Yet how do you say no to a thirsty, tired old man when he asks for water?
Without a second thought, the shopkeeper, Ravi, who was very kindhearted,
poured out a tumbler of water from his pot and gave it to the old man. The
man drank it up greedily. Then he said one more word: ‘More!’ And without
waiting for Ravi to give it to him, he lunged for the pot, picked it up and
lifting it to his lips drank up Ravi’s entire day’s supply of water!
Poor Ravi, what could he do? He just stared in dismay. Then he told
himself, ‘Never mind. After all, I did help someone in need.’
The stranger, meanwhile, now seemed to feel better. He handed the pot
back to Ravi, gave a smile that filled Ravi’s heart with warmth and said, ‘My
son, always be kind like this. Help everyone who comes to you like you
helped me, and you will be blessed.’ Then he picked up his stick and slowly
hobbled down the road. Ravi watched the strange old man disappear into the
distance, then returned to his shop.
The afternoon heat grew worse. After a while Ravi felt his head was about
to burst with a headache. His lips were parched and his throat hurt, it was so
dry. He really needed a drink of water. But the visitor had finished it all up!
Hoping to coax a drop or two out of the pot, Ravi lifted it to his lips and tilted
it. Imagine his surprise when a gush of water ran down his face! It was sweet,
refreshing water which not only quenched his thirst, but wiped out his
headache too.
Ravi was staring at the water pot, trying to figure out what had just
happened, when Karim limped into his shop. Karim was a young man who
had hurt his leg in an accident many years ago which had left him with a limp.
When he was unwell or tired, his limp became worse. Karim, too, flopped
down on the bench in front of the store and caught his breath, like the old
man. Then he fished out a shopping list from his pocket and handed it to Ravi.
As Ravi started packing up the items listed on the paper, Karim opened a little
bundle of food and ate his lunch sitting on the bench. Finally he wiped his

mouth on his scarf and pointed to Ravi’s pot of water. ‘Mind if I take a little
sip? It is so hot after all.’
Ravi was busy measuring out some dal. He said without looking up, ‘I
would be happy to offer you some, but someone’s already had most of it.
Then I was feeling unwell and I think I finished the last of it.’
‘What are you saying, my friend? I can clearly see the pot brimming over
with water!’
Ravi looked up and stared in disbelief. In front of his eyes, Karim poured
out a tumblerful of water and drank it. Then he paid for all his groceries and
left the store.
Did his limp look as if it was nearly gone? Ravi watched him for a while
trying to figure out, then decided the heat was playing tricks on his mind and
went back into the cool comfort of his shop and dozed off.
He woke with a start as someone was calling his name urgently. He opened
his eyes to find Karim back. This time he was holding by the hand his little
sister Fatima. ‘Brother, wake up. We need your help,’ Karim urged.
‘Wh-what? Is something wrong?’
‘Fatima is burning up with fever!’
‘Then go to a doctor, why have you got her to a grocery shop?’
Karim stared at him and said, ‘You mean you don’t know how you just
helped me? My leg, which has been troubling me for the last many years,
healed up on its own as soon as I drank the water from your magic pitcher!
Give Fatima a drink from it, too. I am sure her fever will disappear in no
time.’
Ravi was astounded. Magic pitcher? Healing water? What was Karim
going on about? Nonetheless he passed the pot to Fatima. She drank a bit,
then sat down to rest. Within minutes she lifted her head and said, ‘It is true,
brothers! I am indeed cured of the fever!’
Soon the news spread in the village like wildfire. Ravi, the quiet, kind
grocery storekeeper, was now the owner of a magic pitcher, the waters from
which could heal anyone of any disease. Every night Ravi left the pitcher in
the store, and in the morning it would be filled to the brim with sweet, cool
water. Daily, a queue of sick people and their relatives collected in front of his
shop. To each one Ravi gave a drink of the water, and they went away saying
they were now better. The pot was never empty. Ravi realized the old man he
had helped must have given him this gift in gratitude. Ravi understood what a
great gift it was and thanked him daily in his mind.

Soon his little store turned into a hospital. Ravi did not charge a paisa for
the water. People would leave some money, some gifts for him, and others did
not pay him anything but he was still happy with that.
One day, a rich landlord’s servant appeared at his doorstep and said, ‘My
master is unwell. Come with me and give him a drink of your water.’
Ravi replied, ‘See the crowd of people behind you, waiting for their turn.
How can I leave without helping them and go to your master? Do you think
these sick people can stand in the sun for long? Tell your master to come to
me instead and I will give him the water here.’
The servant said, ‘Ravi, what will you get by helping these poor people? A
few rupees? Some rice and dal? Come to my master’s house. He will shower
you with money and gifts. Your worries about making ends meet will be over
for at least a month.’
Ravi was tempted. It was true, why not cure one rich man and get some
help in buying his daily needs? Ravi told the people waiting outside to come
back the next day and went with the servant to the landlord.
Slowly, in this way, Ravi changed. Where once he could not bear to see the
pain and sadness of the sick and poor people, he now started each day hoping
he would get one rich patient at least, who would pay him handsomely.
Days passed thus. Seasons changed and it was summer once more. Ravi
was in his old store, writing up his accounts, when the voice of an old man
quavered in his ear, ‘Son, water!’
Startled, he looked up. Was it the same old man who had given him the gift
of the magic pitcher? But right behind the visitor was none other than the
king’s messenger. ‘Come quickly!’ the messenger shouted. ‘The queen has
been bitten by a mosquito!’
‘Water!’ the old man repeated.
‘The queen is unwell!’ the messenger shouted again.
Ravi looked from one to the other. One was a grubby old man who may or
may not be the same person who gave him the pitcher. On the other side a
messenger from the king himself! He pictured the gold coins showering down
on him once his healing water soothed the queen’s mosquito bites. The choice
was clear.
He picked up his pitcher and said to the stranger, ‘Wait right here, Uncle,
I’ll be back soon.’
The king’s swift-footed horses took him to the palace. There he rushed to
the queen who was staring in dismay at the mosquito bites on her arm. He

tilted the pitcher to pour some water into a tumbler, but nothing came! Again
and again he tilted the pitcher. He turned it upside down and stared into its
depths. It was dry as a bone.
‘You cheat!’ the king roared. ‘So this is how you have been fooling the
people of my kingdom! Get out, and never let me hear that you have acquired
magical healing powers. If you claim such a thing again I will banish you
forever from the village.’ Then he turned to comfort his queen who was
splashing tears on the bump on her arm.
Ravi slowly walked back to his village. He went to his shop. No one was
there. He searched for the old man who had asked for water. He was nowhere
to be seen. He called out, ‘Uncle, I am sorry. I made a mistake. Please do
come. I will give you water.’ But there was no reply. Now he realized this was
the same old man whom he met a year back.
He remembered the people he had healed once out of kindness and
compassion and how much they had blessed and loved him in return. He
remembered their little acts of generosity, sparing him a few coins, a bundle
of vegetables from their garden in return for the water. When did he become
so selfish and greedy that he would neglect the people who had needed him
the most? The old man had taken back his powers when he sensed Ravi had
misused the gift.
Never mind, Ravi smiled to himself. He would use the money he had
received for the water to help bring a real doctor to the village, someone who
would help the people with his knowledge of medicines and diseases, so that
they need not wait for a magician to cure them of their illnesses.
From that day onwards Ravi filled his pitcher with ordinary water from the
stream and carried it back carefully to his little store and waited for the old
man. Maybe one day he would be back, but till then, Ravi was determined to
bring a real medicine man to his village.
Ajji finished her story and looked around at the four little faces around her.
Raghu was deep in thought. Ajji smiled at him. Then the children shouted,
‘Ajji, tell one more story!’
‘Ah ha,’ Ajji said, ‘too many stories a day are not good either. One laddoo is
very sweet, very delicious but if you eat laddoos all the time it’s no fun. Go

and play outside. Tomorrow I will tell you another story.’ With that she got up
and went to the kitchen to supervise the dinner.

Kavery and the Thief
The children had gone with their Ajja to the paddy fields that morning. They
were all city kids and did not know a thing about farming! On the way, Anand
was surprised to see a bird’s nest on top of the tree. He said to Ajja, ‘I wonder
how birds decide where and how to make their nests!’ Ajja said, ‘The straw in
the nest is from the paddy field. Do you know, farming helps human beings as
well as birds?’ Krishna replied, ‘Ajja, I thought wheat and rice can be just
plucked from trees, like mangoes. But today I realized there is so much work
in farming.’
That afternoon, after lunch, when they gathered around Ajji for the day’s
story, she looked sharply at the children. They had enjoyed learning about
farming activities like cleaning seeds and separating the straw from paddy. In
the city everything came from the supermarket, but here they had seen how
things were really produced.
Ajji said, ‘Farming is very important. If farmers do not grow any food,
what will we all eat?’
Anand said thoughtfully, ‘If farmers do such important work, why are they
so poor?’
‘That’s true, my dear,’ Ajji sighed, fanning herself. ‘Of course there are rich
farmers too, people who own lots of land. But many in our country till small
pieces of land, and so make less money.’
Then seeing the kids’ crestfallen faces, she put down her fan, sat up and
said, ‘But I can tell you of a poor farmer woman who did not remain very
poor. All due to her sharp wit!’

‘Tell Ajji! Do tell!’ the kids yelled. So Ajji started her story.
Kavery’s lazy husband annoyed her no end. There she was working like a
donkey in the fields, ploughing and watering and tending a hard, dry piece of
land, while her husband snored away happily at home! Why, once when a
stranger came asking for some food and water, he just pointed towards the
kitchen and went back to sleep. The stranger, thankfully, was an honest man
and took only enough for himself and his horse. Not that there was much to
steal in Kavery’s little house. They were poor farmers with only a patch of
land where nothing seemed to grow. Somehow Kavery tilled the land, did
some odd jobs in the neighbourhood, and made ends meet.
The land was right next to a temple. On some days her husband would
come along with her on the pretext of helping her, but no sooner would her
back be turned than she would find him stretched out near the temple
courtyard gossiping with passing villagers.
One day, as she was working in the field, trying to dig up the ground so she
could sow some seeds, a thin man with a big moustache appeared beside her.
He was a thief, and up to no good. Kavery, of course, did not know this. She
greeted him politely and went back to her work. Now the thief wanted to steal
the coins that were given as offerings in the temple and perhaps even the
ornaments on the idol. The only way into the temple was by digging his way
in from Kavery’s land. But how could he do anything there, with this tough,
no-nonsense woman working away?
Guessing Kavery was hard up for money, he whispered to her, ‘Sister, why
are you working so hard on this barren land? I will give you one thousand
rupees, sell it to me.’
Kavery raised her eyebrows; why did he want to buy the land for so much
money? Surely something was wrong . . .
The thief sensed she was not about to sell it to him, so he raised his price:
‘A thousand and fifty? No? Two thousand? No again? FIVE THOUSAND?
No?’
Kavery kept shaking her head. She did not like this odd-looking man who
was offering her so much money for the field. Clearly he had some evil plans.
Finally, to keep him quiet, she made up a story. ‘I will never sell this land.
You see, it belonged to my ancestors. Now we are poor, but I am told that
once our family was very rich. Though we lost a lot of our money, much of it

was also buried here, in this field by one ancestor, to keep it safe from
robbers. Then people forgot about it for years and years. My husband found a
clue to the location of the hidden treasure just a few days back. Why do you
think I am digging this hard earth? Not to sow seeds, oh no, that’s just what
everyone thinks. I am actually looking for hidden treasure!’
The thief was stunned. He felt this woman was really innocent, giving such
important information to a stranger. He thought, why should I not take
advantage of this situation? Here he was, hoping to steal a few coins from the
temple, and this woman was telling him about hidden treasure! He replied in a
very humble way, ‘Yes sister, I understand; after all it is your family treasure.
Only you should get it.’ He pretended to walk away, and went and hid himself
a little way down the road.
Night fell; Kavery packed up her tools and headed home. The temple, too,
emptied out and the priest locked it up for the night. Then at midnight, when
all was quiet and the night creatures were coming out of their homes, the thief
crept into the field.
All night he dug and dug, looking for treasure, but of course there was no
sign of it as there never had been any treasure to begin with! By the time
dawn broke he realized Kavery had made a fool of him and all he could do
now was get away from the field fast.
When Kavery reached the field she grinned to herself. Just as she had
expected, the thief had spent the night digging up the land nicely for her. All
she needed to do now was sow the seeds. She worked hard in the field for the
next few months and managed to grow a good crop. She sold those and finally
they had some money. With a part of this money Kavery bought some
jewellery.


Many months later, the thief decided to show his face in the village again.
He was careful to disguise himself, though. He trimmed his long moustaches,
tied a colourful turban and pretended to be a travelling salesman. No sooner
had he stepped into the village than he saw Kavery going about her work. But
what is this . . . Instead of the simple, unadorned lady he saw last year, she
was now wearing jewellery which looked as though it had been in the family
for years! Surely she must have located that missing treasure finally! He was
determined to look in her house and find the rest of her money and treasure.
That night, he appeared at Kavery’s house and said to her husband, ‘I am a
traveller and don’t have a place to spend the night. Please give me shelter for
the night.’
Kavery’s husband agreed immediately. Kavery, however, glimpsed the man
from inside the house and saw through his disguise. She knew he must be
planning some robbery, so she said in a loud voice, making sure the visitor
heard her, ‘Oh dear, your dear aunt is all alone at night and has asked us to
come stay with her. You know how the dark scares her when your uncle is not
there. Come, let us go there for the night.’ Then lowering her voice a bit, yet
making sure she was heard clearly, she continued, ‘Don’t worry about the
jewels. I have hidden them in little holes in the house walls. No one will
suspect the hiding spot.’ Then she came out and in her normal voice told the
thief, ‘Brother, you can sleep in the veranda. The house will be locked. Here
is some food and water for you. We will come tomorrow morning.’ The thief
smiled to himself at Kavery’s foolishness.
Her husband, meanwhile, stared at her with an open mouth, wondering
which aunt and what jewels she was talking about. When she firmly walked
off, he followed obediently.
The thief could not believe his luck. He had the entire night to comb
through the house, tap all the walls and look for the hidden stash of gold
ornaments. So he started. Tap tap tap. Kick, punch and shove. He prowled and
he tapped, he kicked and he pushed the walls, hoping to spot the jewels.
Finally he tore down all the walls. But, of course, there was nothing he could
find. Exhausted he fell asleep and woke only with the crowing of the cock as
the sun rose. Quickly he found his little bundle of things and ran off. Within
minutes Kavery and her husband returned.
‘Oh Kavery, see what the bad man has done to our house! You gave him
food and shelter and made me come with you leaving the man alone in the
night,’ her husband wailed. But Kavery was smiling! Then she broke into

peals of laughter and said, ‘Don’t worry. I had planned this all along. You see,
I saved money from our last crop to rebuild the house. I needed to call in
some labourers to help tear it down, but our guest has done it for us! Now we
can make a larger house for ourselves, just the way we always wanted.’
The whole village heard the story and started marvelling at her intelligence.
Many months flew by. The thief was burning to take revenge. How dare that
village woman trick him, that too not once but twice! He realized that she was
very clever.
One day, he dressed up as a bangle seller and started wandering in the
village. Kavery spotted him and knew who he was at once. She said to her
friends who were crowding around the bangle seller, ‘Oh dear, I would have
loved to get some for myself. But ever since that good-for-nothing thief tried
to steal all our money by tearing down our house, I have hidden everything in
a little hole in a tree in the woods.’
‘Which tree?’ her friends asked.
‘Oh no, I am not saying which tree, but it is at last safe and sound out in the
forest.’
The thief looked at her. Yes Kavery was wearing an ordinary sari with no
ornaments at all.
Her friends turned around in astonishment at the crash with which the
bangle seller flung down his collection of bangles and made off for the forest.
Only Kavery watched with a grin on her face.
Out in the forest, the thief searched high and low for the jewels. He
climbed trees, poked around in bushes, got bitten, scratched and growled at,
but he would not give up. The jewels were there somewhere and he had to
find them.
So that is where we will leave him, prowling around in the forest, looking
for money and gold that don’t belong to him. Everyone praised Kavery for
her quick wit in ridding the village of the thief. She continued to work hard
and made more money from her farming and became a rich old lady. Even her
husband was shamed into giving up his lazy ways and helping her. As for the
thief, who knows, perhaps he is still in that forest, looking for what was never
his. Now if only he had learnt to work hard like Kavery—he would have been
as rich!

The children laughed and laughed when the story was over. ‘The poor thief!’
Meenu and Krishna giggled. ‘Maybe he got eaten by a tiger!’
Ajji grinned. ‘See,’ she told Anand, ‘sometimes with a bit of luck and lots
of pluck, people can change any situation in which they find themselves!’

Who Was the Happiest of Them All?
Meenu was upset. She pouted and sulked and would not talk to Ajji. But
how can any child be angry with Ajji for very long? Their grandmother was
just too loving and affectionate for anyone to not tell her what was wrong.
‘Ajji, it’s been three days, and you have not told a story about a king yet!’
Meenu grumbled.
Ajji nodded. ‘It’s true, Meenu. That was my fault; I should have told you a
story about a king right away!’
‘And I want a good, nice king, who does good, nice things for his people—
not horrible things like punishing them and jailing them,’ Meenu sat straight
and demanded.
‘All right, dear. Here’s a king, just as you wanted . . .’
And Ajji began her story.
King Amrit loved his people and looked after the affairs of his kingdom well.
His minister, Chandan, was a wise man who helped the king in his work
tirelessly.
One day, King Amrit and Chandan were taking a walk on the terrace of the
palace. The terrace offered beautiful views of the surroundings, and they
could see far into the distance. They spotted the weekly market from up there,
with people in colourful clothes buying and selling all kinds of things. There
was plenty to buy and people had money to buy, too. There were no poor
people to be seen anywhere. The king watched with a smile on his face. He

was delighted to see the prosperity of his kingdom. Like any good ruler he
was happy when his people were happy.
He turned to Chandan and said, ‘See how contented my people are. But I
want to check this first-hand by talking to them. Tomorrow, summon people
from all walks of life to the court, and I will ask them myself how they are
doing.’ Chandan was used to the king’s strange requests, so he nodded and
went off to carry out this order.
The next day, the king arrived in court humming a happy tune to himself.
Seeing all the people gathered there waiting for him, he was even more
pleased. He cleared his throat and said in a loud voice, ‘I have called you here
to ask you a very important question. As your king, I need to know if all of
you are contented. Do you have enough for your needs? Do you know anyone
who is not happy about anything?’
The citizens looked at each other, thought for a while and slowly one by
one they came forward to answer. One after the other they all said how happy
they were—their kitchens had enough food, their trades and businesses were
doing well, the king had made them feel safe. The farmers had grown good
crops and the rivers and ponds were full of fish. What more could they ask
for?
The king became more and more pleased as he heard this. Only Chandan,
his minister, watched and heard everything with a frown on his face. Why?
What was wrong? Soon he walked up to the king and whispered something in
his ear. King Amrit’s eyebrows rose up in astonishment. Surely, Chandan
could not be serious! But he looked at the minister’s face and found no trace
of this being a joke.
He turned back to the court and made a most unusual announcement. ‘I am
delighted that all of you have said you are happy. But I want to test this.
Tomorrow, I want all the happy people of this kingdom to come and meet me
in the royal gardens. But I have a condition. All of you will have to enter the
garden from the main gate, walk across and meet me by the gate at the rear of
the garden. I will wait for you there. When you enter the garden you will be
given a sack each and you can pick whatever fruits or flowers your heart
desires.’
An excited buzz broke out among the crowd. It sounded like a lot of fun.
No one was usually allowed to enter the king’s special garden. He had planted
trees from all over the world in that garden and it was said to be filled with all
kinds of beautiful and strange plants.

Right on time the next day, everyone gathered at the gate of the garden. At
the time the king had told them, the guards opened the gates and handed out
the sacks. Men, women and children started roaming around the beautiful
garden. They spotted juicy apples and plump mangoes hanging from trees.
They picked these till they saw ripe pomegranates bursting with juice, grapes
and colourful flowers no one had seen before. People went about picking
whatever they wished for and filling their sacks with them.
But as they walked further into the garden it became wilder, more like a
forest, and there they saw trees laden with apples of gold, mangoes of silver
and flowers studded with gems and jewels!
Everyone emptied their sacks of the fruits they had collected earlier and
started madly filling them up with these precious fruits and flowers. They all
forgot that they had said they had more than enough for their needs at home.
Greed took over, their minds and all they could think about was adding more
and more valuables to their sacks. The fruits which they had picked earlier,
and had tasted to be as sweet as nectar, now lay in heaps around the garden—
forgotten and left to rot.
Then with their sacks filled right to the top, the citizens made their way to
the rear gate of the garden where the king was waiting. But what was this? To
their astonishment they found a raging stream stopping their way. Water
gushed down from behind some rocks and rushed over pebbles and big
boulders through the garden. The stream was narrow, but the current was
strong. There were no boats to take the people across. Clearly, the only way
was to swim. But how could they swim with such heavy sacks filled with gold
and silver fruits?


The people stood by the stream for a long time scratching their heads. Then
one young man did what they all knew needed to be done. He simply
abandoned his sack by the stream, waded into the water, then swam across to
the other side. Slowly the others, too, followed suit. Sadly, some wailing in
distress, they left their sacks filled with what they had thought was the riches
of a lifetime, and dived into the stream. Then they walked up to their king—
wet, unhappy and angry.
King Amrit and Chandan watched them trudge up in their soaking clothes.
Chandan had a small smile on his lips, while the king looked sad. When they
had assembled in front of him, he said, ‘When I asked you yesterday if you
were happy with your lives, all of you said you were contented and did not
need anything more. Yet, today I can see the sadness in your faces when you
had to leave behind the riches you had gathered in my garden. If you were
really happy with your lives, why did you gather the jewel fruits, and why are
you so sad now?’
Everyone looked down, ashamed at their behaviour. Only the young man
who was the first to cross the stream after leaving his sack behind seemed to
be unconcerned. Chandan spotted his cheerful face in the crowd and
beckoned him forward. Then he asked, ‘Tell me, are you not sad you had to
leave behind so much of wealth that suddenly came your way?’
The man said, ‘I didn’t pick the jewelled fruits and flowers. I had picked
some of the lovely, tasty fruits and had eaten my fill of them. In my sack I had
kept some others for my little daughter who is at home. I had thought she
would enjoy these tasty apples and mangoes. But when I saw there was no
other way to go across the stream, I did not think twice about leaving my sack
by the river. My little girl can get tasty fruits from some other garden, too!
But I am so happy the king let us all wander around his garden, looking at the
trees and plants and animals. He is a great king for having created this place
of beauty, and it was a pleasure walking around there.’
Finally a smile appeared on King Amrit’s face. Chandan turned to him and
said, ‘Your Majesty, I hope you now realize that people’s contentment does
not end with having enough food or money. They also need to be truly happy
inside. Only then will they not be swayed when they gain or lose wealth. That
is a lesson that everyone—whether a king or a commoner—needs to
remember.’
The king nodded, as did his subjects. This was a lesson they would not
forget in a hurry!

‘Did you like the story, Meenu?’ Raghu asked.
‘Oh yes,’ Meenu nodded. ‘But I liked the minister more than the king!’
‘That’s true, Meenu,’ Ajji agreed. ‘Kings did need intelligent ministers to
show them the right path sometimes. Remember Akbar had Birbal, and
Krishnadevaraya had Tenali Rama? Why just kings, we all need someone to
tell us if what we are doing is wrong. It could be our parents, grandparents,
teachers or even our best friend. The important thing is to listen to them and
change our ways when needed.’

The Enchanted Scorpions
What an exciting morning the children had had that day! Ajja had asked for
their help in cleaning up his old storeroom. Ajja loved to keep all kinds of old
things in that room, much to Ajji’s annoyance. She firmly believed the room
was the principle attraction for all the cockroaches, mice, termites and other
such bugs in the house. Every summer holiday the children spent a day
clearing out the room, exclaiming over all the treasures they had unearthed.
Ajja even let them keep some of the odds and ends they found. That didn’t
please their mothers too much though!
Today they had found an old wooden box. It was a big box, beautifully
carved all over with flowers, and vines and leaves. Inside, it had little
compartments to keep all manner of things. Now these compartments were
empty, but Raghu, who had been reading Treasure Island, imagined that once
these were full of gold and silver coins, gems as big as eggs and all kinds of
fantastic jewels.
After examining the box thoroughly, the children decided that the day’s
story had to be about lost treasure. Ajji, who knew a story about anything
under the sun, started right away.
Siddharth was a young, good-natured merchant. Looking for work, he arrived
in a village. He liked the people of the village so much that he decided to use
all his savings, buy a house and live there forever. While searching for a
house, he met Uday.

Uday was a poor man. His family had once been extremely wealthy
landowners but were now not so well off. Uday was looking to sell his old
family mansion in order to pay off his family’s loans.
Siddharth loved the house Uday showed him and bought it immediately.
Then he set about repairing the mansion, which was in ruins. As he dug out
the old flooring, he found a sealed box buried underground. When he opened
it, to his surprise, he saw it was filled with scorpions. He flung the box away
in fright.


That evening, he went to visit the wisest man in the village and asked him
about the box of scorpions. The wise man thought for a while, then said,
‘Perhaps Uday’s ancestors hid some money in that box and buried it, to be
used when someone in the family needed the money. Over the years they
must have forgotten about the existence of the box.’
Siddharth was still puzzled. ‘But the box contained scorpions,’ he said, ‘not
money.’
The old man smiled. ‘The box is protected by an old spell. If it is opened
by anyone other than a family member, it will appear as if it is swarming with
scorpions. Only a true family member will be able to see that the box contains
money.’
Siddharth was sad to hear this story. He remembered the tears that had
sprung up in Uday’s eyes as he had looked back at his ancestral house for one
last time before leaving the village. If only he had known about the hidden
treasure, he would not have had to sell the house. When Siddharth reached
home, he decided to keep the box safely till someone from Uday’s family
came to claim it. To make sure that the box was taken only by a true
descendant of Uday’s family, he took four scorpions from the box and hung
them in four corners of his newly opened shop.
All his customers would comment when they entered the shop. ‘Siddharth,
are you mad? Why have you hung dangerous insects in your shop? Do you
want to scare away shoppers?’
Siddharth would only smile. He knew his goods were the best for miles
around, and people would come to shop at his store, scorpions or not.
Gradually the shop came to be known as the Scorpion Shop and the villagers
laughed at him behind his back. But Siddharth did not care.
Many years passed. Siddharth was now a middle-aged man with a wife and
children and enough money. But he had one regret. No one had come to claim
that box.
One day, a young boy walked into the shop and said, ‘Sir, I have heard
from many people in the village that you are wealthy and often help those in
need. I had to stop going to school because I could no longer pay my fees.
Could you please lend me some money so I can finish my studies?’
Siddharth shook his head sadly. ‘The villagers have exaggerated about my
wealth,’ he said. ‘Yes, I am earning enough, but not so much that I can help
you or lend you money, though I would have loved to do so.’

The boy flared up in anger when he heard this. ‘Sir, if you do not want to
help me, please say so openly. Why do you lie? You have so much money that
you don’t know what to do with it. Why else have you hung gold coins in the
four corners of your shop? Surely you can spare some coins to help a poor
student like me.’
Siddharth stared at him in astonishment. ‘Wh-what? What did you just
say?’ he asked, his eyes bulging in excitement.
‘I said if you don’t want to help . . .’ the boy repeated.
‘Yes, yes, I heard that,’ Siddharth cut him short. ‘But what did you say after
that, about the gold coins in my shop?’
The boy now looked at Siddharth doubtfully, afraid that perhaps this
excited old man was a bit mad. ‘I said you are so wealthy that you have hung
gold coins in the four corners of the shop. There they are, for the world to
see!’ And the boy pointed to what appeared to Siddharth as four writhing
scorpions.
Siddharth gave a happy whoop of laughter. He rushed forward and hugged
the boy.
‘Are you related to Uday Kamalakar? Did your family ever live in this
village?’ he nearly shouted into the boy’s ears.
The young man stepped back in alarm. Perhaps this rich man was mad and
dangerous after all. ‘Y-yes, my name is Uday. I was named after my
grandfather. His family lived here for many generations. Then, when they fell
on hard times, my grandfather sold his old house and moved. He never
recovered from the grief of having to sell his ancestral property and died
heartbroken.’
Siddharth wiped away the tears from his eyes. ‘Wait here, my son,’ he said.
Rushing to his house, he came back with the old box and gave it to the young
boy. ‘Go on, open it and tell me what you see,’ he chuckled.
The boy opened the box and his eyes nearly fell out of his head. For he held
in his hands more treasure than he could dream about in his wildest fantasies.
The box was filled with gold and silver coins and jewels!
He looked up in astonishment at Siddharth, who was grinning broadly.
‘Yes, it belongs to you,’ Siddharth explained. ‘I have held it safe for many
years, hoping someone from Uday’s family will come to claim it. Your
troubles are now over. Go home, use the wealth of your ancestors judiciously
and do well in life.’

Then he told the boy the story of how he had found the box which appeared
to be filled with scorpions to anyone who did not belong to Uday’s family.
Uday was amazed when he heard the story. He offered Siddharth half his
wealth in gratitude. But Siddharth would hear none of it. ‘This is yours,’ he
insisted. ‘Go, enjoy your life.’
Uday went away with the box, and all his life he remembered the funny,
honest old man who had kept his wealth safely for him.
‘How lovely, Ajji!’ Krishna gasped. ‘If only we had such a shopkeeper in this
town!’ All the children agreed that that would have been such fun. Ajji
laughed at their dreamy faces. Then she shooed them out to play in the
garden. And do you know what they played till late in the evening? Treasure
hunt, of course!

The Horse Trap
The next day, there was a surprise summer shower. The land smelled
beautiful. The thirsty earth had soaked in every drop of rainwater. The
children had been very busy shifting the puppies and kittens, who were
roaming in the back and front yards, into the house so that they did not get
drenched in the rain. Their respective mothers were very busy shifting the
pappadams left to dry on the terrace. Summer is the season when, under Ajji’s
leadership, pickles and pappadams were made.
Meenu started a calculation. ‘Everyone needs at least five pappadams per
day. For the next one month 600 pappadams will be needed. Tomorrow our
neighbour Vishnu Kaka’s three grandchildren are coming. They will also eat
with us these tasty pappadams. We may have to keep five per head . . . That
means Ajji has to prepare 600 + 50 pappadams.’ When Ajji listened to
Meenu’s mathematics, she laughed and said, ‘Don’t calculate that way. It may
be true today that we will all eat five pappadams a day, but this may not be
true for every day. After eating pappadams for three days, one may get bored.
There is a wedding in my brother’s house and we all might go there. So we
may not eat any pappadam those days. The way you are calculating, reminds
me of the man who calculated the number of horses, once in England . . .’
All the children immediately gathered around her. ‘Oh Ajji, you must tell
us this story of how the horses were counted.’
So Ajji had to stop what she was doing right there and tell them the story.

Many many years ago, in England, there lived a great thinker and scholar
called George Smith. He thought a lot about how it would be in the future,
and advised the prime minister about many things. He researched how many
people would live in the country in twenty years’ time, he calculated how
many schools, hospitals and roads needed to be built, or how much food
needed to be grown or bought from other places to feed all these people.
His calculations helped the government immensely in planning for the
future.
George often needed to visit the prime minister’s office to talk to him about
some new project and advise him. One day, the prime minister had invited
him for a meeting, so he hopped into his horse carriage and set off for the
office. Now George was always deep in thought and rarely noticed what was
happening around him. Today, too, he sat in his carriage thinking about farms
and ships and houses. But suddenly his carriage stopped with a jolt and he
was shaken out of his thoughts. There was some commotion on the road and
all carriages had stopped around him. Normally George would have just sunk
back into his thoughts again, but today something stopped him. A horrible,
strong smell. A smell that hung in the air and made you cover your nose with
a hanky if you were not a scholar wrapped up in your own world.
Today, somehow, George was not able to disconnect himself from what was
going on around him. The smell kept wafting into his nose and taking his
mind away from the problem he was tackling. He called out to his coachman,
‘Hi John, what is this extraordinary smell?’
John the coachman was used to his master’s absent-minded ways, and he
replied briefly, ‘Horse dung.’
Horse dung! Now that was something George had never given a thought to.
Somehow, he could now think of nothing else. Soon his carriage pulled up in
front of the prime minister’s office. But George kept sitting inside, lost in
thought. Finally John tapped on the window to tell his master that they had
reached their destination.
George walked to the visitor’s room still thinking. He was sitting there,
reflecting on horses and their dung, when the prime minister’s secretary came
to meet him. Now Adam, the secretary, was not as learned as George, but he
was very sharp and intelligent. He greeted George and said to him
apologetically, ‘The PM had to make time for another important meeting, and
will be late in seeing you. I hope you don’t mind waiting.’


George kept staring out of the window, watching yet more horse-drawn
carriages rushing up and down the road. Thinking he had perhaps not heard
him, Adam cleared his throat and repeated loudly, ‘Mr Smith, the PM . . .’
‘Yes, I heard you, Adam,’ George mumbled.
Worried that this great thinker of the country was in some trouble, Adam
asked gingerly, ‘Is something bothering you? Perhaps I could help . . .?’
George looked at him excitedly, ‘You know, I just looked into the future
and realized we will all die in about a hundred years. Our country will be
destroyed, our way of life gone forever. And do you know why? All because
of horses . . . and their dung!’
Adam stared at George, puzzled. Surely he could not be serious?
George continued, ‘See, now we use horses as the principal mode of
transport in the country. They are used to draw carriages, in the king’s stables,
even in the farms.’
Adam nodded. This was true.
‘So how many horses are there now? Let’s assume that there are 500 rich
families who can afford to own a horse carriage. If each family has at least
two children and all of them are rich enough to own carriages, that will mean
a minimum of two more carriages in a few years. Each carriage would require
two horses. So, each rich family would be using four horses at the least. So
then there will be 2,000 horses. If you add our king’s cavalry, and the number
of horses in the farms, the numbers increase substantially.’
Adam nodded. Yes, this sounded true enough, but what was George’s
point?
‘How do we get rid of the dung they generate now?’
Adam answered patiently, ‘We dig pits and empty the dung into them.’
George nodded, ‘Now that’s my point. Imagine the scene a hundred years
from now. 2,000 horses would have increased to 400,000, given the way the
population is increasing. This will mean more dung! And what will we do
with all this dung? Humans will need more space and houses and farming to
sustain themselves. Where will we find open land to dig up and bury the
dung? It will lie unattended everywhere and cause horrible diseases. If they
make their way into the water sources it will be even worse. We will end up
poisoning ourselves and our environment. We will become sick, and our
country will become poor just by tending to so many sick people, and finally
our way of life will just die out—as we all will. All because of horses!’

Adam sat and thought about this for some time. George’s thoughts and the
grim picture he had painted of the future was scary indeed. But . . . here
Adam’s practical thinking kicked in; what if things did not work exactly the
way George was seeing it? He turned to his friend and said, ‘Mr Smith, you
are not taking into account one very important bit into your calculations—the
ability humans have to innovate and adapt. Many years ago there were no
carts or carriages, we went everywhere by foot. Then once we started
domesticating animals we realized we could use them for transport too. But
do you think humans will rest with this achievement? Who knows, in a
hundred years what other modes of transport we would have invented so that
we may not require horse for transport at all. Perhaps we will even be able to
fly like birds!’
George never solved this problem in his lifetime. Neither did Adam live to
see how true his thoughts about the future had been. Man went on to invent so
many new ways of moving from place to place that horses are no longer used
in the numbers they once were. James Watt invented the steam engine, which
led to the invention of railways. Then cars were invented by Karl F. Benz and
became widely used in cities for transport. Finally the Wright brothers
showed that humans could fly—in aeroplanes! With all these great inventions,
the horse and other animal-drawn carts and carriages are now a thing of the
past.
Truly, if man did not innovate and experiment, our species would have died
out—just like George had predicted!
Everyone was very happy this story. They all teased Meenu. ‘You are the
George Smith of our house. Who knows one day nobody will eat pappadams
and Amma may not prepare that many pappadams. We may even buy directly
from the shops if it is a small number.’
Meenu felt very embarrassed. She hid her face with a pillow. Ajji said,
‘Don’t make fun of her. Foresight is very important. If you don’t have
foresight, then you will land up in trouble like Ramu.’
‘Who is Ramu?’ the children immediately asked Ajji.
‘I will tell the story of Ramu only tomorrow.’ And Ajji bustled off. The
children knew she would tell only one story a day, so they eagerly waited for
the next day to hear Ramu’s story.

A Treasure for Ramu
Vishnu Kaka’s grandchildren had come to visit him. Vishnu Kaka was a very
good friend of Ajja’s. They had lived next door to each other for years.
Unfortunately, his wife Vasanthi Kaki had died a few years back. Though
there was a cook, his grandchildren—Sharan, Suma and Divya—always
preferred to eat in Ajji’s house, which Ajji also welcomed.
With seven hungry children to feed, Ajji realized telling a story would be a
good way to keep them quiet till the food got cooked. Ajji started the story
while peeling the cucumbers.
Did you know that sometimes even the gods in heaven can get into an
argument? That’s what happened once when Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth,
found herself cornered by all the other gods. Together, they accused her of
one thing—that she never stayed in one place for too long! ‘No sooner are
you comfortably settled in one house, do you decide to leave it, and off you
go elsewhere!’ they said to her.
Lakshmi sniffed and said, ‘That’s not true. I stay in a house as long as I am
welcome. If people think ahead, work sincerely and spend money wisely, I
stay with them forever. Unfortunately often when I am in one place for a
while, people behave strangely, and I have no choice but to leave.’
The other gods pooh-poohed this and refused to believe her. Poor Lakshmi
decided she needed to show them proof of what she had just said. Here is
what she did to show that she was correct. Remember, many human years

make only a second in god years. So what took years to happen on earth, the
gods could see in only a few minutes.
Ramu and Rani were farmers. They worked hard in their fields and earned
enough money to feed their children and meet their other needs. They were
not rich and sometimes had to make do with fewer new clothes and not very
nice food.
One day, Rani was digging a corner of her garden in order to plant a tree.
As she dug deeper, there was a loud clang! Her shovel had hit something
metallic hidden underground. Excited, she dug faster, till she pulled out a
large metal box. When she opened it she could not believe her eyes. It was
filled with gold and silver jewels! For a while Rani stood dumbstruck. Then
she did a happy whoop and ran home with the box under her arm.
‘Ramu, Ramu, see what I found buried in our garden!’ she yelled.
Ramu was writing up the accounts for the month, and for a while paid no
attention to his wife. Only when she came up to him and did a happy jig
around him did he look up. Imagine how his mouth fell open in surprise when
he saw the box of jewels.


Soon Ramu and Rani were the richest people in the village. They stopped
going to work—after all, what was the need, they told each other. Why work
in the hot sun when they had piles of money at home? They left their small
cottage and moved into the biggest house in the village. They had servants
who worked day and night doing every small job, so the two did not need to
lift even a finger. There was a cook who cooked delicious meals, a person to
serve it, another just to clean shoes and one person to even fan Ramu as he sat
on his bed the whole day and gossiped with his newfound friends.
Then Ramu decided village life was too boring and they moved to the big
city. There they had another big house, more servants and lots of fun at
various parties. Slowly they forgot the good things that had once made them a
well-loved family. They forgot to work hard, to help others in their need, or to
just be nice people. They thought that with money they could buy anything,
including respect. They behaved rudely to others. They spent more and more
money on clothes and parties, and as they did no work at all, the money
started dwindling. They started borrowing from others which they soon could
not pay back.
One day, Ramu looked sadly at his account book. It was now filled with
numbers that showed he only needed to pay others; there was hardly anything
left for himself. In a heavy voice he called out to his wife, ‘Rani dear, the
good days are over. I think we forgot to be the kind of people Goddess
Lakshmi likes. She has gone elsewhere, and we are left with nothing.’
Rani stood silently for a while, then replied, ‘Never mind, Ramu. We have
learnt our lesson. I now think of the days when I would work all day long and
go to sleep a tired person and sleep soundly. I would fall into a deep slumber
as soon as I Iay down on the bed. Now I lie awake all night, wondering which
sari to wear the next day and what to do with our money. I am too fat to even
dig, like I did when I found the treasure!’
Ramu smiled and hugged his wife. ‘We’ll go back to our village, and to our
old ways. We will work hard like we did once, and we will help everyone
around us. Maybe that will make Lakshmi come back to us one day. And even
if she doesn’t, we will try and be happy with what we have.’
So Ramu and his family went back to their old home. And do you know
what? They did live happily ever after!

The gods watched what was happening with Ramu and Rani from the heavens
as Lakshmi entered and then left their house. They had to agree with her—if
the people of the house she entered became nasty, then what could she do
except leave, and hope they saw the error of their ways?

The Donkey and the Stick
Ajji was on an outing with her daughter and daughter-in-law, Sumati and
Subhadra. One lived in Bangalore and the other in Mumbai. They were
returning the next day as they had used up all the leaves their offices had
given. The children would remain at Shiggaon though, with their
grandparents. Everyone was looking forward to this stage of the holidays. The
children because there would be no parents telling them what to do, to Ajji’s
delicious food and to fun outings with Ajja. The grandparents, too, were
looking forward to having the children to themselves. The rest of the year it
was only the two of them in the house.
As Ajji walked with the two younger women, they talked about how
difficult it was for them to manage their office work and the children. Ajji
listened silently. Then Sumati said, ‘But they are so good when they are with
you, Amma. How do you manage them so well?’ Subhadra nodded. ‘I have
read so many books and articles to find out about this, but nothing works the
way it is written in books.’
Now Ajji said, ‘Do not always go by what you read in books. Learn to use
your life’s experiences, read between the lines.’ Then she grinned and said,
‘Otherwise you will become like the people in the story about the donkey and
the stick!’
Sumati and Subhadra forgot they were at the temple and clamoured
together, ‘What is this story? Tell us!’ Ajji shook her head. ‘Now you are
behaving like children. But you are my children after all. All right, come join
us at night when I tell today’s story.’

That night the two mothers were the first to appear to listen to the stories.
The children were surprised to see their mums, and Ajji started her story.
Aruna Marg was a busy road. It connected a number of villages to each other
and many people, animals and carts used it every day. Walking along that
road, a group of students discovered a rock which no one had bothered to look
at in many years. ‘Look!’ they told each other in excitement, ‘there is
something written on the rock. What can it mean?’
They called out to their teacher. When they examined the rock carefully,
they found the markings were actually little drawings. One showed a stick,
and the other a donkey.
By now a large crowd had gathered. Everyone was puzzled. What could
these strange drawings mean, they asked, scratching their heads. They
decided to go to the ashram of a wise sage nearby and ask him. But when they
trooped into the ashram, they found to their disappointment that the sage had
gone on a long pilgrimage. Only his young disciple was there, looking after
the cows and calves.
They asked the disciple if he could throw some light on the strange
drawings. Now this young man was not very bright. But like many foolish
people he loved to put on an air of learning and pretend to be very clever. He
examined the drawings carefully and minutely. Then he proclaimed, ‘It is
very simple. This is the drawing of a magic stick. The man with the stick is
the hero of this place. He died protecting this village centuries back. Each
person using this road must worship the rock and make an offering to it. The
one who ignores it will become a donkey!’


The villagers were astonished to hear this strange explanation. But they
were devout people and on that very day they set up a shrine around the rock.
They installed the foolish disciple as head priest in charge of taking offerings
from passing travellers. The disciple was pleased with his brainwave. Of
course he did not know what the silly drawings meant, but he no longer had to
run after calves and get kicked by angry cows in the ashram! He could sit by
the rock the whole day, taking his pick of the offerings to the rock and mutter
a few mumbo-jumbo prayers.
His happiness lasted a few months—till the wise old sage returned to the
ashram. The old sage was annoyed to find his disciple missing and his
beloved animals roaming around, uncared for. Then he looked into the
distance and saw a large crowd gathered by the road. He went to investigate,
and found his missing disciple there, looking happy and well fed, busy
accepting offerings for a rock. He stood watching for a while. Then he walked
up to the rock and closely examined the pictures. Without saying a word, he
picked up a stout iron rod and, to the astonishment of the gathered crowd,
started moving the rock. Many came forward to help him and when they had
been able to move the rock, they found a pot of gold under it!
The sage said to the people gathered around him: ‘The pictures meant you
had to move the rock with an iron rod and find the hidden money. If you
didn’t, you were all like donkeys. You should not follow rituals and the words
of others blindly. Think for yourselves and understand why you are doing
what you do. If you had given this some thought, you would have recovered
this treasure many months ago. Instead, you wasted your time and money
making offerings to a rock and helping this greedy disciple of mine become
fat and make fools of you. This treasure belongs to all of us. Let’s use it to
keep this road in good repair so everyone can use it and go about their work
in peace.’
The villagers hung their heads in shame for they realized how foolish they
had been. As for the disciple, he had to clean the cowsheds for many months
to atone for his greed.

‘What’s in It for Me?’
Ajja told Anand, ‘Will you go fetch my clothes from the dhobi?’ Anand was
reading a book, and said without looking up, ‘Then what will you give me?’
Ajja smiled and said, ‘I will give you nothing. Why should I give you
anything? You are a part of the family.’ Anand looked up now. ‘Oh! But that
is not true in our house,’ he declared. ‘Whenever my dad tells me to do some
work, I ask for a reward and he gives it to me.’ Ajja was surprised. ‘Let me
talk to your father. The joy of helping someone itself is a reward. This is not
right.’
‘Dad is a big officer in a bank. Can he make mistakes?’ asked Krishna with
great surprise.
‘He may be an officer in the bank but at home he is your father and my son,
and I will talk to him. If you go on like this you will become like “Mushika”.’
‘What’s a “Mushika”?’ asked Sharan.
Ajja looked around. There was no sign of Ajji. Probably churning out some
last-minute masala powder for the mothers to take back with them. He looked
pleased. ‘Today I will tell you a story. Of a Mushika and what happens if you
want to be paid for every little thing.’
Mushika the mouse walked jauntily down the road, whistling a happy tune to
himself. There had been a storm earlier in the day which had got rid of the
summer heat. He had just eaten a big, juicy mango that had fallen in the
storm, so his tummy was full and he was as pleased as Punch. On the road, he

saw a twig, also fallen from the tree above in the storm. Now a mouse will
store and keep anything, hoping it will be of use one day. So Mushika picked
up the twig in his mouth and set off.
A little ahead he met a potter. The potter was sitting with his head in his
hands. Why? Because his oven had been drenched in the rain and now he did
not have enough dry wood to light it again. How would he bake his pots and
sell them?
As the potter sat wailing in front of his house, Mushika walked up and
watched him for some time. ‘Wossh up, brother?’ he asked with the twig still
clutched in his mouth.
At first the potter paid no attention to the strange talking mouse. Then
when Mushika asked him again and again, he told the little creature why he
was crying. Mushika nodded, kept the twig aside and said, ‘See, this twig has
dried in the wind and can be used to light your kiln. I’ll happily give it you,
Brother Potter, but what’s in it for me?’
The potter thought hard and, deciding that a little mouse could not ask for
much, said, ‘I will give whatever you ask for.’
In a flash Mushika replied, ‘Then give me that large pumpkin that is lying
in the corner of the room.’
The potter was astonished—how can a mouse carry a pumpkin? Besides,
he had been looking forward to the lovely pumpkin curry his wife would
make for him that night. ‘Choose something else, little mouse,’ he urged. But
Mushika was stubborn—the pumpkin for the twig or nothing.
So the potter gave Mushika the pumpkin. The mouse was delighted. He had
made a mighty human do what he wanted! He left the pumpkin near the
potter’s house saying he would collect it soon and set off down the road
again.
Further ahead, a milkman was sitting by his cows, shaking his head.
‘What’s up, Brother Milkman?’ asked a tiny voice. To his astonishment the
man saw a mouse with bright eyes peeping up at him.
Sadly he shook his head some more, then said, ‘The storm scared my cows
and they are refusing to give me milk. What will I sell today and what will my
family eat?’
‘Spicy pumpkin curry—if you want!’
‘Surely you are joking, my friend. I have ten people at home. Where will I
get a pumpkin large enough to feed everyone?’

‘Just walk back the way I came. You will reach a potter’s house. Right
beside that I have left a pumpkin. That’s mine, and you can have it. But
what’s in it for me, Brother?’
The milkman shrugged and said, ‘Whatever you want.’ Like the potter he
thought, what can a mouse want?
Mushika said, ‘Then give me a cow.’
‘Are you mad? A pumpkin for a cow? Whoever has heard such a thing?’
‘It’s that or nothing, my friend,’ replied Mushika firmly. So the milkman
went and got the large pumpkin and gave one cow to the mouse.


A big cow with large horns that listened to what he commanded! Mushika
the mouse could not believe his luck. Off he went, seated on the cow,
whistling another happy tune, when he stopped in front of a marriage hall.
Why were people standing around looking sad and worried? They should be
busy preparing for the marriage feast! Even the bride and groom were
standing, with long faces.
‘What’s up, Brother Groom?’ called Mushika, sitting atop his cow.
The groom replied gloomily, ‘There’s no milk to prepare the wedding
kheer. How will the wedding feast be complete without the dessert?’
Mushika grinned. ‘Worry not. Here, take this cow, she is now happy and
will give you milk. But what’s in it for me, Brother?’
The groom was very happy and said, ‘Why, you can have whatever you
want! You can eat your fill of the feast—sweets, pulao, fruits, whatever your
heart desires.’ The mouse kept quiet and gave the cow to the wedding party.
They milked the cow and had plenty of milk. There was a great wedding
feast. After the party was over, the mouse replied in a flash, ‘Give me your
bride!’
The groom and everyone in the marriage party were astonished at the
mouse’s cheek. The groom was about to give him a good whack, when his
newly wedded bride stopped him. ‘You had given him your word that he
could have whatever he wants. Let me go with him. I’ll teach him such a
lesson that he will never try to carry off another human bride again!’
Her husband agreed, so off she went with the mouse.
Mushika scampered ahead, eager to show the bride his home. But what was
this, why was she walking so slowly?
‘Hurry up, Bride,’ he called. ‘It’s about to rain again.’
The bride replied, ‘I am a human, I can’t run as fast as you.’
So Mushika had to slow down. By the time they reached his home, which
was a little hole under a tree, he was very hungry.
‘Cook me a nice meal with lots of grain,’ he commanded.
The bride nodded and said, ‘Of course, but where is the kitchen, the spices,
the oil and the vessels? I am a human after all. I can’t cook only grains.’
The mouse realized he was in a real fix having got this useless human back
with him. ‘Never mind,’ he sighed. ‘At least come inside the house.’
‘Oh, but how will I do that?’ wailed the bride. ‘I cannot set even a toe
inside that hole, it is so small. Where will I sleep tonight?’

‘Err, how about under that tree?’ Mushika suggested, pointing to another
big tree nearby.
‘No way,’ sniffed the bride. ‘It will rain and I will get wet and I will catch a
cold, then a fever, and I will need a doctor, who will give me bitter medicines
. . .’ Now she started wailing even louder.
‘Shush shush,’ Mushika comforted her, thinking he should have agreed to
eat his fill of the wedding feast instead of bringing this strange whiny woman
back home with him. ‘How about you stay in that temple veranda for the
night?’ he suggested, pointing to a big temple across the road.
‘Oh, but thieves and robbers will come there, and try to snatch away my
lovely jewels,’ cried the woman. Then suddenly she dried her tears and said,
‘What if I call my friends Ram and Shyam to protect me?’
Before Mushika could say anything, she whistled loudly and called, ‘Ramu,
Shyamu!’
From nowhere a big dog and cat appeared next to her and made as if to eat
up Mushika. Oh, how he ran and saved his life by jumping into the safety of
his hole.
The bride grinned and went back to her wedding feast with her faithful
pets. As for Mushika, he had to go to sleep on an empty stomach that night.
‘Tomorrow,’ he sighed, ‘perhaps there will be another storm,’ and went off to
sleep.

The Princess’s New Clothes
After their mothers went back, Ajji took all the children on a shopping spree.
They went to the biggest clothes store in the town. Ajji had filled her purse
with notes and told all the seven children, ‘Each of you can buy one dress. It
is our gift to you. Remember, I have Rs 500 for each of you to buy one dress.’
At the store she chose a nice comfortable chair. The children were allowed
to decide which clothes they wanted and in which colour. They could go into
the trial room and try them out before buying. After an hour, everybody had
whatever they wanted, except Krishna. She had tried on many many dresses
but found fault with all of them. She told Ajii, ‘This store does not have
anything nice for me. Shall we go to another one?’
‘What is wrong with this one? It is a well-known store,’ Ajji remarked. But
Krishna pouted and complained that she already had the colours and cuts
available here, so everyone trooped off to the next shop. There, too, after a lot
of thought, finally, Krishna chose her dress. Ajji had been watching all this
with her typical soft smile. On the way back, as they piled into the taxi, she
whispered to Krishna, ‘It’s good you chose a dress finally. But beware, or else
you may turn out to be like that princess . . .’
‘Which princess, Ajji?’ the children asked.
‘The one in the story.’ Ajji was now looking out of the window.
‘Tell us, oh tell us!’
So Ajji told them the story of the princess who never liked any of her
clothes.

The king and queen of Ullas were very sad. No one was attacking them, the
subjects were happy, the farmers had grown a bumper crop . . . then why were
they so sad? Because they longed for a child and did not have one.
One day, they learnt of a place in the forests in the kingdom, where if you
prayed hard and well, you were granted your wish. They went there and for
many days prayed to the goddess of the forest. Finally their prayers were
heard and the goddess appeared before them and asked what they wished for.
The king and queen bowed low and said, ‘We wish to have a child.’
‘So be it, you will soon have a little girl,’ said the goddess, shimmering in
the greenery. ‘But remember, though she will be a loving child, she will have
one flaw. She will love new clothes too much and it will make life difficult for
you. Do you still want such a child?’
The king and queen wanted a baby so much they would have agreed to
anything. So the goddess granted them their wish and vanished back among
the trees.
Soon, as had been said, the queen gave birth to a lovely baby girl. Oh, what
a beauty the little thing was, with her jet-black hair and thick eyelashes and
long toes and fingers. They named her Beena. The kingdom rejoiced in their
king’s happiness and for a while there was complete joy everywhere.
Beena grew up a child loved by everyone. She became prettier by the day,
and with her charming manners and ready laughter, she filled everyone’s
hearts with joy. But, as the goddess had said, she did have one flaw—she
loved new clothes! She loved clothes so much she had to have a new outfit
every day. She would refuse to wear the same clothes twice! Tailors from all
over the kingdom and even outside created beautiful, extraordinary clothes for
her. Silk, cotton, wool, you name it, and Beena had a dress or sari of that
material. Blues, greens, reds, pinks, every colour in nature was present in her
wardrobe.
For a while the king and queen were happy to let her have new clothes
every day. But soon they realized they were spending all their money and
time in finding new tailors and clothes for their daughter! This had to stop.
They coaxed and cajoled and pleaded and scolded, but Beena remained
unmoved. Her parents understood this was the flaw the goddess had warned
them about, and finally decided to send Beena to the goddess to find a
solution.
Beena entered the dark, green forest and waited for the goddess to appear.
She came in a flash of green light, which lit up everything around her. Folding

her hands, Beena told the goddess why she had come.
‘I know your problem, my child. I will send you a new outfit every day. It
will be unique, its colours and design will delight you. But you should
remember one thing: you cannot wear anything else, or exchange these
clothes with anyone else. If you ever do that, your life will be miserable.’
Happily Beena agreed to this. After all, why would she be unhappy if she
got a new dress every day?
From then on, Beena woke up each morning to find an extraordinary new
sari or dress lying by her bed, ready to be worn. It was a dream come true for
her! She enjoyed herself no end, choosing matching earrings and bangles and
shoes, and everyone kept telling her how pretty she looked.
Yet after some months the excitement died down. No one remarked when
Beena sashayed in wearing another fantastic dress. ‘Oh, it’s the goddess’s
gift,’ they all said. ‘It’s not something you or I can ever have,’ all her friends
said and shrugged and went their way.
Beena grew sad. Then one festival day, while walking near the river, she
noticed a girl wearing a simple cotton sari. There was something about the
way the girl walked and how attractive she looked which made everyone turn
and stare. Beena noticed how the people were admiring the girl. She became
jealous because no one noticed her beautiful clothes any longer, yet they had
such praise for this simply dressed girl. She forgot all about the goddess’s
warning and went up to the girl and said, ‘Will you take my dress and give me
your sari in return? It is so lovely that people can’t take their eyes off it.’


The girl was astonished. The famous Princess Beena was offering to take
her sari, and was giving her a marvellous outfit in exchange! She could not
believe her luck and happily gave her sari to Beena. She then wore Beena’s
dress and went away. No sooner had Beena worn the girl’s sari than there was
a flash and a bang. Her surroundings changed, and she found herself
transported deep inside the forest, in front of the goddess.
‘Beena,’ the goddess called. ‘I had told you that you cannot give away or
exchange the clothes I gave you. But you have done just that! I am afraid
there is a punishment for not listening to me. I will have to take you away
from the world of humans forever.’
Beena looked down in sadness. She thought of her parents’ tear-stained
faces, the grief of the people in her kingdom who had loved her dearly. Then
she spoke aloud, ‘I will go away, but do grant me one last wish. Turn me into
something that will remind everyone about their beloved princess, something
they may even find useful.’
The goddess smiled and turned Beena into a plant. Do you know what plant
Beena became? An onion! Have you noticed how the onion has so many
layers? Those are all the dresses that Beena once wore. And have you noticed
your mother’s eyes water while she cuts onions? That is because unknown to
ourselves, like all the people in Beena’s kingdom, we still shed tears the
beautiful, kind-hearted princess!
After listening to this story, Krishna wailed, ‘Ajji, I don’t want to be like
Beena. I don’t want to get turned into an onion! I promise not to fuss over my
clothes from now on!’

The Story of Paan
Vishnu Kaka had invited the entire family for dinner. It was a lavish meal
with many courses. Everyone ate their fill, enjoying each dish. After it was
over, the children gathered around Kaka as he brought out his big box of
paan. They loved watching Kaka choose and mix his ingredients to make
delicious paans which the grown-ups then ate with blissful looks on their
faces.
He explained to the children, ‘A paan contains betel leaf, betel nut and
lime. But we should use only so much of each ingredient. Only then will it
taste good.’ All seven children wanted to try this experiment on their own.
Some of them chewed on only the leaf, some on the nut, and others on the nut
and leaf, or the leaf and only lime. It was true, when the three were not put
together, the paan tasted horrible! In fact, Sharan vomited when he added
more lime than necessary! Everyone made a beeline for the mirror to check if
their tongues were red or not.
Ajji was sitting and chatting with Sharan’s mom and watching their antics.
Then she called out to them and said, ‘Children, by this time you must all
know that the leaf, nut or lime on their own taste very bad. Even if you put
just two together it is no good. Only when you add the three in a perfect
combination can a paan be eaten. And that’s when you get that red colour in
the mouth!’
‘Why is that, Ajji? Is there any special meaning?’
‘Yes there is a special meaning and I’ll tell you the story, which I first heard
from my grandmother.’

Once upon a time, there were two brothers, Bhanu and Veer. Their parents
died when they were young and Bhanu brought up his younger brother with a
lot of love and care. When Bhanu was old enough, he married Bharati. She
was a gentle, loving person and looked after Veer with as much love as her
husband.
When Veer was about twenty years of age, he heard that their king was
looking for soldiers to join his army, as there was going to be a war. Veer
decided to join the army. Oh, how much his brother and sister-in-law cried
and pleaded, telling him to remain at home with them. They could not bear
the thought of the boy they had brought up with so much affection going so
far away from them. But Veer insisted on becoming a soldier, so they let him
go away, with a heavy heart and tears in their eyes.
For many days there was no news of Veer. The king went to war,
vanquished his enemy and returned. The soldiers who went with him also
came back home. But of Veer there was no sign. Day after day his brother and
sister-in-law watched out for him, hoping to see him come walking down the
road, back home. But there was no one. Then, one day, a group of soldiers
passed through their village, returning home from the war. Bhanu called out
to them and asked about his brother.
‘Veeru, oh yes, so sad, he died, you know, in the battlefield,’ said one,
shaking his head.
‘No no. He was injured, and he recovered. Did he not come home?’ said
another.
‘He was on his way home when he fell ill,’ informed a third.


On hearing these awful tidings, Bhanu was deeply saddened. He decided he
could not live at home waiting for his dear little brother to return. He would
go and look for him. When he told his wife, Bharati too decided to go with
him. Together, they set off one day to look for the missing Veer and bring him
home.
They decided to go to the site of the king’s big battle, where Veer was last
seen by his companions. This place was far away and they had to travel
through forests and valleys and mountains and deserts. The two walked and
walked, over many miles, but poor Bharati was not strong enough. One day,
after travelling through a thick forest, they reached a little hamlet. Bharati sat
down, exhausted. Then to Bhanu’s great horror she died out of sheer
exhaustion. Unable to bear his grief, Bhanu too died immediately.
Over many years at the place where the couple had died, two trees grew.
One was a tall tree and the other a creeper that hugged the tree. It was as if
Bharati and Bhanu were together even in death.
Meanwhile, Veer, the brother they had loved so deeply, was not really dead.
He had got terribly wounded in the war and spent many years recovering from
his injuries in a little village far away from home. When he finally recovered,
he came back as fast as he could to his old house, knowing how anxious his
family would be for him.
But imagine his surprise when he found the house locked and bolted,
abandoned for many years. Slowly the neighbours gathered around and told
him how Bhanu had decided to go looking for his lost brother.
That night Veer cried many bitter tears. How would he find his beloved
brother and sister-in-law now? Where were they? By the time morning
dawned he had made up his mind. He would try and go the way they had
travelled and find them. Immediately he set off.
Veer was a soldier, but he had only lately recovered from many wounds and
was not too strong. It took him many days to walk across the difficult land
Bhanu and his wife had crossed. Then one day, near a forest, he came across a
little shrine. The villagers told him the sad story of how the shrine came to be.
Years ago a couple had arrived at the spot, tired from days of walking. Legend
had it that they were on the way looking for a long-lost brother. When the two
died without fulfilling this wish, two wonderful plants, unknown to anyone
earlier, had grown at the spot. The leaves and nuts from the trees were so
sweet and refreshing that the villagers decided to build a small temple for the
man and the woman at the place.

Veer listened to the story with growing sorrow. He realized the couple they
talked about was none other than his brother and his wife. Unable to bear the
news, he turned into a statue of limestone.
Do you know how they have all been remembered ever since? The tall tree
grew nuts called areca nuts, the creeper’s leaves were paan or betel leaves and
from the statue came the lime paste that is added to preparations of paan. And
this is how this loving family came together even after death. Together they
taught people the values of love, unity and loyalty, and when people chew
paan they remember this story.
Sharan’s mom was surprised to hear this story. ‘Really, Ajji,’ she said, ‘even I
was not aware why these three ingredients are always used to make a paan. I
too will come to listen to your stories from now on!’
Ajji nodded, then she added with that glint in her eyes, ‘Chewing paan is
not good for your teeth. Everyone, off you go to brush your teeth!’

Payasam for a Bear
Ajja and Vishnu Kaka were planning something! They could be spotted
grinning and nodding and whispering. The children were dying to know what
it was. Then one evening, they finally broke the news. They were all going on
a picnic! It would be a picnic at the nearby falls. These waterfalls were really
beautiful, with the river meandering close by and the forest just across. The
children got even more excited when the two grandpas revealed the rest of the
plan. Tomorrow would be a rest day for Ajji and Sharan’s mother, because all
the cooking would be done by them and the children! And they would do it
the traditional way, by gathering firewood and then cooking the meal from
scratch.
The children were so excited they could hardly sleep that night. All they
could talk about was the picnic and what they would cook. Before nodding
off they had decided the menu—pulao and kheer! Payasam or kheer is so easy
to make, and who doesn’t love it?
The next day, even the usual late risers were up and about and ready to set
out for the picnic by seven o’clock. Oh, what a beautiful spot it was! They all
ran around exclaiming over everything and getting ready with their cricket
bats and balls for a game. Ajji sat comfortably under a big tree. Then it was
time to get lunch ready. Everyone started looking for twigs to use as firewood.
Ajji spotted Divya straying towards the dense thicket of trees and called out,
‘Divya, come back, don’t go there. Who knows what animal is there, and on
top of that you all are going to cook payasam . . .’

Minu’s ears pricked up immediately. ‘Why, Ajji, what does payasam have
to do with animals?’
Ajji grinned, ‘But bears love payasam! Don’t you know?’
Everyone declared they had never known this piece of information. So
cooking and games forgotten, young and old gathered around her to hear the
story of a bear who wanted to eat payasam.
Did you know that you must never ever anger a bear? It is true; an angry bear
can do some really awful things, so it is always safer to keep your word to
him. Poor Mohan and Basanti did not know this, and tried to trick a bear, and
see what happened to them!
Mohan had a banana plantation, where he grew delicious bananas. He also
had a huge mango tree that provided him with baskets of juicy mangoes every
summer. He would sell these fruits in the market and lived happily enough
with his wife, Basanti.
Once, his trees yielded an exceptionally large crop of bananas and
mangoes, and he decided to sell them in the market in the city, where he
would get a higher price for them. So off he went with his sacks and baskets
to the city. There he sat in the market, sold everything that he had brought,
and made quite a bit of money. At the market, he ran into an old friend, Amar.
Mohan and Amar were overjoyed to see each other after many years.
‘Come to my house, dear friend,’ insisted Amar. ‘Let us enjoy a good meal
and talk about our childhood days.’
Mohan thought this was a wonderful idea, and went with Amar to his
house. There the two friends ate huge quantities of rice, dal, lovely vegetables
and all kinds of sweets. Then, finally, out came the best part of the meal—the
payasam!
Payasam is known by many names all over India. Some call it kheer, some
payesh, and others, payasam. It is made with milk, rice and jaggery and many
other ingredients, and it is always yummy! So was the payasam that Amar
served his friend. It was made with fragrant rice, creamy milk, sweet-as-sugar
jaggery, and strewn with nuts, cardamoms, saffron and all kinds of wonderful,
mouth-watering things. Mohan ate and ate bowl after bowl of this dessert, till
he was ready to burst.
Then the two friends chatted and rested, till it was time for Mohan to head
back home. When he reached his house, he told his wife about the

scrumptious meal, particularly the payasam he had eaten. Oh, how Basanti
sighed and longed to have tasted this dish too! Seeing her face Mohan
suggested, ‘See, I have earned plenty of money by selling the fruits. Why
don’t I buy the things required to make payasam, which you can cook and
both of us will enjoy it together?’
Basanti thought this was a wonderful idea. But first Mohan needed to go to
the forest to collect some firewood. Then he could go to the shop and get all
that was required to make the dessert. So off Mohan went, swinging his axe
and whistling a tune. Now who would be sitting dozing under a tree in the
forest but a big black bear. He had just had some nice berries for lunch and
was enjoying his snooze, when Mohan walked by. First the bear opened one
eye, then another, and watched as Mohan cut a few branches of a nearby tree
and collected twigs for firewood. Just as Mohan was tying it all up in a neat
bundle, the bear spoke up.
‘Hi there, friend. Where are you off to in such a happy mood, and why are
you collecting so much firewood? Tell me, are you cooking a feast tonight?’
Mohan was astonished and a little scared to be addressed like this by a bear.
‘Y-yes, your honour, I mean, dear bear, ss-sir,’ he mumbled and stammered.
The bear was happy after his meal, so he decided to chat some more with
Mohan.
‘So tell me, what are you going to cook tonight?’ he asked, patting his
tummy.
‘P-p-payasam,’ answered Mohan.
‘Paya . . . what?’ The bear was puzzled.
‘Pa-ya-sam,’ Mohan said slowly. ‘It’s a sweet dish.’
‘Tell me more!’ The bear was intrigued.
So Mohan described payasam and how it was made. As he talked about
milk and rice and nuts and jaggery, the bear’s eyes started gleaming, his
stomach started rumbling, and he realized he absolutely, totally needed to
taste this wonderful human food.
‘Oh Mohan, my friend, do let me come and share your payasam tonight,’
the bear begged.
Mohan was astonished. A bear as a guest for dinner! Who knows how
much he would eat! But neither could he say no—that seemed so rude, and
the bear was looking at him hopefully.
He sighed and replied, ‘All right. You can come. But to cook so much
payasam I will need much more firewood. Can you bring that with you?’

Cunning Mohan thought he would make the bear do his work for him, so
he would not need to come to the forest for the next few days.
‘Yes, yes!’ The bear jumped up. ‘Just tell me how much firewood you need.
Ten? Twenty? Thirty bundles?’
‘Umm, fifty would be enough,’ decided Mohan. Then he slung his bundle
of firewood over his shoulder and went back home. On the way he bought lots
of milk, rice and everything else they would need to make the payasam.
When he reached home he told Basanti about the unusual guest who would
come to share their dessert. So Basanti cooked a huge quantity of payasam.
She added lovely nuts, aromatic saffron, sweet cardamoms and many
wonderful things into it as she cooked. Oh, how marvellous the payasam
smelt. Unable to wait any longer, the two started eating helping after helping
of the dish, without waiting for their guest to turn up. They ate and ate and
ate, till they realized they had eaten up everything! There was not a grain of
rice, nor half a nut left for him!
They sat around wondering what to do. What would they say to the bear
when he came expecting to eat payasam? Then, a devious plan entered
Mohan’s head. What if they made payasam with all kinds of other
ingredients? After all, it was only a bear, and he had never tasted this dish
earlier, so how would he know what it really tasted like?
The cunning man and his wife then took a little bit of milk, added lots of
water to it, threw in a handful of rice, and instead of jaggery and nuts and
spices they added pebbles and sand and cardamom husks and stirred and
stirred the mixture till it looked somewhat like payasam. They placed the
brass pot filled with this in front of the house and went and hid in the bushes
somewhere at the back.
As soon as night fell, a huge dark figure appeared down the road. On its
back it carried fifty bundles of firewood. It was the bear, come to dinner!
He reached Mohan’s house and looked around. There was no one. Then,
right in front of the house, he spotted the pot full of payasam. Unable to wait
any longer, he flung down the bundles he had carried and fell upon the
payasam. Only after he had eaten more than half the potful did he realize
something was wrong. The milk was watery, the rice was half cooked and
there was horrible grit and pebbles between his teeth! Ugh!
Oh, how angry he was now! Furious, he shouted out for Mohan. But
Mohan was cowering behind the bushes and did not reply. Now angrier than
ever, the bear spotted the mango tree and rubbed his back against it. The

mangoes came raining down, he shook the tree so hard. The bear continued to
stamp and shake the tree, till it fell with a huge crash right on to the banana
field and crushed the best banana plants. Seeing the firewood he had carried
all the way from the forest lying around, the bear started throwing them
around. One fell into the oven in the kitchen and set fire to the house. Soon
Mohan and Basanti’s house was in flames, his field in ruins and his prized
mango tree destroyed.
Finally satisfied that he had taken his revenge the bear stormed back into
the forest. When Mohan and his wife crawled out of their hiding place and
came back home they saw everything was in ruins. How they wailed and wept
and wished they hadn’t been so greedy and left the bear his share of payasam.


But what was the use of lamenting now? The damage was done, and the
greedy couple had learnt what I told you earlier—never anger a bear! And if
you make a promise to one, keep it!

Fire on the Beard
What a grand picnic everyone had! They played and ate and splashed in the
water till late evening. Ajja and Ajji had to drag them back home. That night
the children tumbled into bed and were fast asleep even before Ajji switched
off the lights. Quietly she tucked them in. The next morning there was no sign
of anyone waking up. Ajja and Ajji went about their work, not waking the
children. But when it was ten o’clock, Ajji decided they had to wake up now.
So she came into the room and found all four were up and chatting in bed.
She looked at them for a while with her hands on the hips. Then she said, ‘So,
I think you’ve had enough rest. Now up all of you. Wash up and get ready. I’ll
give you your lunch by noon.’
All the others jumped up except Anand. He grinned at Ajji and said, ‘You
know, I can live without food if I get to lie in bed all day.’
‘Really?’ Ajji said. ‘So be it. Everyone else, lunch will be ready at twelve,
so be there on time. Oh, and those who lie around in bed will also miss the
afternoon story.’ Then she walked off trying to hide a smile. Anand and miss a
meal! He was the one who loved his food the most!
Anand was quiet. The rest sprang out of their beds and went to brush their
teeth and have a bath. Soon the aroma of onion dosa wafted through the
house. It was too delicious to resist. Everyone gathered in the kitchen to help
grind the dosa batter.
By now Anand was bored and hungry, lying alone in bed. He quietly went
and took his bath. He was worried—what if Ajji had taken him seriously and
not kept a share of the dosa for him? And what if he had to miss that day’s

story? When Ajji saw him appear at the kitchen and join in, she laughed and
said, ‘You have become like Brij.’
‘Who is Brij, Ajji?’
So Ajji started the story while the children ate the dosas.
Yaaawwnnn! Brij stretched out in the sun, yawned loud and long, and went
back to sleep. Is Brij a rich man on a holiday; or has he worked hard all day
and just resting for a while? Neither! Brij was the laziest, most good-for-
nothing fellow you’ll ever meet. He would spend entire days just lying around
on his bed doing nothing. He was too lazy to even trim his beard and it had
grown right down to his knees. All day he sat around combing it and admiring
it, doing nothing else. His mother would call him, his wife would scold him,
but Brij was not one to mend his ways.
This is how most conversations with his wife, Shanti, would go:
‘Can you get some water from the well? There is no water in the house.’
‘The well is dry. There’s no water there.’
‘Can you fetch water from the pond, at least?’
‘The pond is too far. I can’t walk so much for a pot of water.’
‘Then pluck those coconuts from the tree.’
‘Oh, those coconuts are still tender. Let’s pluck them next month.’
‘What about getting some areca nuts from the tree then?’
‘Don’t you know, areca nuts are not good for health?’
‘Help me plough the field then.’
‘It is too hot. The sun will burn my skin. It’s better if you too did not go
there.’
‘Can you at least look after the house when I am in the field?’
‘There is nothing to look after in the house.’
And so on and on Brij would make excuses for not doing any work that
was asked of him. Of course he was never too tired to eat! As soon as his wife
would lay out the meal, he would jump out of bed saying, ‘Oh you have
prepared food for me with such love, it is my duty to eat it.’ And then he
would gobble down all that was given.
When evening fell, Brij would roll out of bed, comb his hair and beard and
set off to meet his gang of friends. Seeing how he managed to get out of doing
any work, many others in the village had decided to do the same. All these
people had formed a club, The Idlers’ Club. They would meet every evening

and sit around and talk about all kinds of things. They claimed this way they
were improving their general knowledge, but all they were really doing was
gossip and boast.
Brij, as the leader of the club, would get to boast the loudest and longest.
One day, the topic was who was the laziest of all.
‘Bathing every day is such a waste of time and precious water. I take a bath
once in two days. That way I even save water!’ said Manoj, the
environmentalist.
‘I never make my bed,’ boasted Suresh, the innkeeper. ‘Why bother when
you have to lie down in it once again at the end of the day?’
‘I eat my food out of the vessel in which it is cooked,’ claimed Raju, the
cook. ‘Putting the food in the plate only increases the work for you will need
to wash it too.’
Now Brij thought he should say something that would beat all these other
tall tales. So he said, ‘I am always cool and calm. Why, even if my beard were
to catch fire I would start digging a well at that time, and never store water
close at hand!’
As these discussions were happening, a real fire broke out in the village! It
burned down buildings and roofs and sheds, crackling and throwing up
sparks, making villagers run helter-skelter looking for water to douse the
flames.
The Idlers’ Club heard all the commotion but no one bothered to step out to
see what was happening. ‘What is going on?’ they only asked each other.
‘Oh nothing,’ Brij dismissed the topic. ‘Must be some circus or the other.
So, what were we talking about?’
By now the fire had spread to their road. It was fast making its way to the
house where the idlers were sitting. It got hotter and hotter. Brij’s friends
started sweating and getting nervous now. Soon the roof of the house caught
fire. Still Brij kept saying, ‘Don’t worry, don’t worry. It will rain now and put
this out.’ Then ‘The wind is blowing in the opposite direction and will blow it
down. We are really cool people, we should not be afraid of a fire!’
Finally his friends could stand it no longer and rushed screaming out of the
house. But Brij was too stubborn, and refused to move. Finally the fire caught
up with him and his beard started getting singed. Now even Brij was scared.
‘Heellp!’ he shouted.
‘Now you can start digging the well,’ his friends suggested.
‘Oh, get me some water from the pond,’ Brij begged.

‘That’s too far away,’ the others shouted from outside. ‘Maybe it will rain,’
they added.
By now the beard was burning away merrily, and all Brij could do was leap
and dance away from the flames. Till suddenly there were splashes and
splashes of water! Someone was emptying cool, cool water on the fire and
putting it out!


Brij could not believe his luck. Who had saved him? Why, it was Shanti
and many other women of the village who had worked hard and drawn water
from wells and ponds to save their homes.
Finally Brij learnt his lesson. Being lazy and pretending to be cool had
certainly not helped him in his hour of need. So he shaved off his half-burnt
beard, woke up early each morning and did all that Shanti told him to do, and
more!

The Way You Look at It
On a sleepy afternoon, while the sun continued to shine, the clouds opened up
and it started to rain. Sharan had fallen asleep after eating at least fifteen
pooris for lunch. When he woke up, he saw a rainbow in the sky. There was a
mild drizzle and the bright sunshine of summer. In the sky was a bold, bright,
clear rainbow. Sharan ran to Ajji’s house and started calling out to his friends.
Suma and Krishna were playing in the garden. Raghu and Divya were
reading. Anand was sleeping. Sharan was so excited he called out to each one,
‘Ajja, Ajji, Suma, Krishna, Raghu, Anand, Divya, come and see this!’
Everyone rushed out to see what was up. The children gazed in amazement at
the rainbow. Living in the city, none of them ever got to see such a vast
expanse of the sky, unhindered by tall buildings. Ajja and Ajji were used to it
and went back to their work.
That evening, while having their milk, the children were talking about
rainbows. ‘The colours of the rainbow are known as VIBGYOR,’ said Raghu.
‘A rainbow is called Indra Dhanush in Sanskrit,’ said Suma.
‘It is known as Kamanabillu in Kannada—the bow of Lord Kamadeva,’
said Sharan’s mother.
‘In the olden days if the sun and rain came together, we used to say it is the
fox’s wedding and all of us have to go on the rainbow to reach the wedding,’
said Ajji.
‘Ultimately it is the same thing, seven colours that appear in the sky when
the sun’s rays are reflected by the rainwater,’ said Ajja. ‘It depends upon the
way you look at it.’

Ajji nodded. ‘The same thing appears different, depending on the way you
look at it, and today I can tell you a story about that.’ Immediately everyone
turned their attention from the sky to Ajji.
During one monsoon season, it rained and rained in Chitpur, a little village by
a mighty river. It rained so hard that the river swelled up. Huge waves lashed
against the riverbanks and carried away trees, houses and big chunks of earth.
The villagers were really scared and prayed hard for the rains to stop.
When finally the skies cleared, one by one people emerged from their
homes. One of them was Raju. He walked down to the riverside. There he
saw something that made him rub his eyes in disbelief. Why, a huge black
rock had appeared there out of nowhere! And what was more, the rock looked
exactly like the head of Ganesha, the god with the elephant head. Raju
immediately prostrated himself in front of the rock. ‘Ganesha not only heard
our prayers and made the rains go away, he has come himself to protect us!’
Raju shouted to no one in particular. ‘I must tell everyone about this!’ he
yelled and ran back to the village to shape the news.
Next came Chetan, the sculptor. He had spent so many days cooped up in
his house waiting for the rains to stop. Now he was glad to be out in the open,
and was thinking of his next piece of work. Suddenly he caught sight of the
new rock by the river. It was just the right colour, worn smooth with age and
river water. It was perfect for the scene he wanted to carve! Giving a whoop
of joy, he ran home to gather his carving tools.
Just as he turned the corner, a merchant came by on his horse. The animal
was thirsty and he stopped there for it to have a drink of water from the river.
He too spotted the stone. ‘What a big stone!’ he remarked. ‘And it is nice and
smooth and flat. Let me sit for a while on it and rest.’ After enjoying a nice
rest on the rock, the merchant decided he would tell his friends about it. They
were travelling together and all of them would be thrilled to be able to sit
there for some time, by the river.
He went off to find his friends.
Just then, Ajit, a soldier, came on his horse. He got down and washed his
face. While his horse was drinking water, he was looking around and the
same stone caught his attention. He was surprised and said to himself, ‘What
a huge stone on the riverbed! Maybe I should get it removed so that in an
emergency it should not become a hindrance on the road. Our army can

march better if such obstacles are not there. I must inform my commander.’
Thinking so, he rushed back to his camp to talk to his commander.
Later in the day Bholu, the village washerman, appeared by the river with
his big bundle of clothes. To his astonishment, he found a crowd right around
his favourite washing spot. They were all arguing over a rock! Pushing his
way into the crowd, Bholu spoke in a loud voice, ‘Hey! What do you think
you all are doing?’


Raju now burst out, ‘This rock is a sign from Lord Ganesha, I want to
worship it.’
Chetan raised his voice even louder and said, ‘No no, this rock is going to
be used for my next sculpture.’
The merchant shouted, ‘I have invited all my friends to rest on it! It is
ours!’
Ajit was giving orders to his soldiers to remove the stone.
Bholu now grinned and said, ‘But this rock has been here for years and
years! Earlier half of it was submerged in the mud. Now with the rains the
mud has got washed off, and you are seeing more of it. The washermen of
Chitpur have been using this rock to do our washing for many, many years!
There’s nothing miraculous about it. Now off with all of you, I have work to
do.’
So saying Bholu emptied his bundle of clothes and set to work. What could
the others do? They had to go away grumbling quietly to themselves.

Roopa’s Great Escape
Ajja’s and Vishnu Kaka’s houses were teeming with people! There was a
village festival, and friends and relatives from near and far had come to
Shiggaon. There were people the children had not seen or even heard about
before. Some said, ‘I am your father’s fourth cousin.’ Someone else said, ‘I
am your grandmother’s second cousin.’ The houses were full and there was a
lot of fun and laughter everywhere. Nobody expected a separate bedroom or a
special dish at the dining table. They all ate together and talked to everybody
and slept on the floor on mattresses. The city children were surprised at the
ease with which the guests made themselves at home. The women helped out
in the kitchen in the morning and in the evening they dressed in shining silk
sarees and went to the fair. In fact everyone dressed in their best, put the two
hundred rupees Ajja gave in their pockets and purses and made for the fair.
The fair itself was quite astonishing. The children from Mumbai said, ‘It is
just like Chowpati on Juhu beach.’ The Delhi kids said, ‘It is similar to
Janpath.’ Others said, ‘It is like Karaga or Kallekai Parishe in Bangalore.’
Vishnu Kaka explained, ‘In every village there is a village god or goddess and
once a year we worship them in a grand way. At the festival and fair it is not
just about selling and buying, it is also about meeting people, exchanging
gifts, having a feast and a good time.’
The group moved from shop to shop, peeping into the photo studios,
examining bangles, waiting for a turn on the merry-go-round and clapping
along to the dances, when someone noticed Suma was missing! Somewhere
in the crowd she had got separated from the rest, and now there was no sign

of her. Immediately her mother started wailing, and Ajji consoled her. Vishnu
Kaka too looked really worried. The children were scared and thrilled too.
This was just like Home Alone! As Vishnu Kaka was about to make his way
to the police assistance booth, they heard Suma’s voice on the mike! ‘I am at
the police station, Vishnu Ajja please come and fetch me.’ When Suma had
been traced, her mother started scolding her. But Suma was not bothered. ‘I
was not worried,’ she said. ‘In the crowd when I realized I was not with you
people, I straightaway went to the police station and told them to make an
announcement.’
Everyone declared she was a very brave and sensible girl, and for a change
that day Vishnu Kaka said, ‘Today I will tell a story about a young girl like
Suma who had a lot of courage. I read this story in a book when I was young.’
Once, there lived a very clever young girl called Roopa. She was an orphan
and had been taken care of all her life by the people of the village in which
she lived. She was very hard-working and once she became old enough, she
lived all by herself and looked after herself. But she always missed having a
family of her own, even though her neighbours were such loving and caring
people.
One day, when Roopa was about sixteen years old, she went down to the
river along with some other women and girls to wash clothes and fetch water.
Diwali was around the corner and everyone was excited. They were
discussing what new clothes they would get. Some were expecting their
husbands and fathers to return to the village with lovely gifts for them and
were looking forward to all the merrymaking that would happen over the next
few days.
Only Roopa was quiet. She did not have anyone to buy her new clothes or
shoes or presents. The villagers were kind to her, but they had barely enough
for their own needs so how could she expect them to get anything for her? Yet
today, hearing all the happy chatter around her, she could not keep quiet any
longer.
‘Even I will get a new sari this year!’ she told Rama, her best friend.
Rama and all the other girls were astonished. Who was going to get Roopa
her new sari? ‘I heard from a distant uncle the other day. He was working for
many years in a faraway city and did not know that my parents had died. Now
that he is back, he has promised to visit me on Diwali. I am sure he will bring

some marvellous gift for me!’ Roopa had started weaving a story, and now
she kept adding, telling all kinds of tales about her imaginary uncle. Her
friends listened open-mouthed. Then they went home, telling each other what
luck Roopa was finally no longer all alone in the world.
As soon as the bunch of women had gone away, who emerged from behind
a tree, but Bholu the trickster. He had been sitting under the tree, planning his
next theft, when he had fallen asleep. Then he had woken up and seen the
women at the river and had sat there still hoping to hear something about the
villagers. Sure enough, he had heard Roopa’s story, and was now ready with a
plan!
Bholu decided to dress up as an old man and appear at Roopa’s house a few
days before Diwali pretending to be her uncle! Then he would take her away
along with any valuables she may have got from her parents.
A week before Diwali, an old stranger appeared at Roopa’s door. He was
carrying new clothes, sweets and other gifts. Roopa was out doing some
errands so her neighbours came around to find out who he was. Bholu acted
perfectly like Roopa’s long-lost uncle, eagerly waiting to meet her. When
Roopa returned home, she found everyone sitting around an old man, who
said he was the uncle she had made up a story about!
Roopa was astonished. How had this happened? She had only been
pretending to have a relative just so her friends would not feel sorry for her,
and now here he was, a real person! Then her neighbour, who had looked
after her all these years, said, ‘Roopa, this is your Uncle Bholu; he learnt he
had a niece and came here looking for you. He wants to take you home with
him and look after you like his own daughter. You are so lucky, Roopa, and
we are so happy for you!’
Roopa looked around at everyone, beaming happily at her, and thought
what harm would there be if she went away with this uncle. She happily
packed whatever little things she owned and waving goodbye to her friends
and neighbours, went off with Bholu.
No sooner had they reached his house than he took off his disguise and
appeared before her as a young man. Roopa was horrified. Oh, what a fool
she had been to believe his story and come away with him! He was nothing
but a trickster.
In Bholu’s house there was no one else but his mother, who was old and
deaf and blind. After eating his lunch, Bholu decided to walk about for a
while, meeting his friends and telling them how he had kidnapped Roopa. She

too ate her lunch, pretended she was very sleepy, yawned loudly and told his
mother, ‘Aunty, I am very tired after that long journey. I am going to bed for a
little while. If your son comes round tell him not to wake me up.’
Bholu’s mother nodded, though she had not heard much. Roopa quickly
went to the other room, borrowed some of Bholu’s clothes, wore them and ran
off. She took with her a few coins and a thick stick to defend herself if need
be. Before leaving, she arranged the pillows in such a way on the bed that in
the evening darkness it looked like someone was sleeping on the bed. Then
she covered the pillows with a dupatta and a sheet. If anyone only looked in
from the door it would seem as if a woman was sleeping on the bed.
Bholu returned home when it was well past evening. His mother told him
Roopa was in her room. He peeped in, saw someone sleeping and went away.
Many hours passed, Bholu kept checking whether Roopa was awake or not,
but each time he saw her sleeping without moving a muscle. Finally, he
realized something was wrong.
He went up to the bed now and pulled back the dupatta and the sheet.
Imagine his shock when he saw nothing but pillows on the bed! Roopa had
disappeared! He ran out immediately and asked everyone around if they had
seen a young, pretty girl walk out of his house. But no one had, because
Roopa had cleverly disguised herself as a man!
Meanwhile, Roopa too had walked many miles till she reached a different
town. There she looked around for work, and was taken in by an innkeeper to
look after the guests and to show them their rooms. Roopa, who now called
herself Rupesh, was happy doing this work. She could not return to her
village till she did something about Bholu, otherwise he would be sure to land
up there and bring her back with him, pretending to be her uncle.
After many days, Bholu turned up at the town. He walked from shop to inn
to market, asking if anyone had seen someone like Roopa. Of course no one
had. Roopa got to know and decided to teach him a lesson. When Bholu
reached her inn, he did not recognize her in men’s clothes. She agreed to give
him a room for the night. She told him, ‘Sir, I will give you a room in the
attic. It is nice and warm and cosy there, and you will be away from this harsh
winter cold.’
Bholu happily agreed and followed her to the room. A ladder was kept in
the middle of the room which went up to a little trapdoor. If you climbed
through the door, you entered the attic. Bholu quickly went up the ladder,
found his bed, wrapped his blanket around himself and went off to sleep.

When it was the middle of the night, Roopa sneaked into the room and
removed the ladder. Then she threw some marbles right under the trapdoor
and stamped loudly around the room. Bholu woke with a start. Who was that
walking around his room? He called down nervously, ‘W-who is there?’
Roopa called out in her man’s voice, ‘Nothing to worry sir. The soldiers are
looking for a thief they believe is hiding in this inn.’
Bholu was really scared. How did the soldiers know he was a thief and a
trickster? He was sure they were looking for him, and decided to make a run
for it. He opened the trapdoor and stepped down. But there was no ladder!
Bholu fell with a loud thud on to the floor! When he tried to get up, his feet
slipped on the many marbles strewn about the room and he went crashing and
sliding all over the place! Finally he hit his head against a wall and passed
out, unconscious.
Roopa had been watching this from the door with great delight. Her plan
was working! As soon as Bholu fainted, she heaved him up and packed him
up in a large box. She placed a nice silk cloth on top of him. Then she
dragged the box outside the inn and stood there.
Soon a bullock cart passed by with two travellers heading for the inn.
When they saw Roopa, or Rupesh, standing outside the inn, they asked, ‘Are
you the manager of this inn?’
Roopa nodded yes.
‘Why are you standing here then?’
Roopa replied in a worried voice, ‘I look after this inn. I was supposed to
go to my own village earlier today to attend a wedding. But there was so
much of work that I could not leave, and now here I am waiting for my cart
with this heavy box.’ Then she lowered her voice and whispered, ‘This box is
full of gifts I bought for the wedding, and if I don’t reach in time, everyone
will be really disappointed.’
The two travellers, who were up to no good themselves, looked at each
other. The same thought had come to both! They said, ‘Don’t worry, brother.
You can take a ride on our cart. Why don’t you put your box on the cart here?
But before we start, would you mind getting us a drink of water?’
Rupesh, or Roopa, smiled to herself, and dragged the box on to the cart.
Then she went inside to fetch the water. She took her time. As soon as her
back was turned, the two travellers opened the box to see what it contained.
They saw some lovely silk cloth on top. Now assured that they had got their
hands on some valuables, they quickly urged their bullocks forward and made

a dash for it. Once they were well and truly out of sight, Roopa grinned to
herself. Her plan had worked! She ran to the nearest police station, and told
them all about the theft.


The two men in the bullock cart were just celebrating their theft of the box,
when they were horrified to see soldiers waiting for them down the road.
What could they do, they wondered. They were crossing a bridge over a river
at that time, and quickly tipped the box into the water. Then they heaved a
sigh of relief and went their way.
So that was the end of Bholu, and Roopa too returned to her village, where
she lived happily on her own. She was not going to trust any stranger any
more!
‘And that’s what brave Suma did too! When she was in trouble she did not
talk to any stranger, but went straight to the police for help. We must always
remain cool like this when in trouble,’ signed off Vishnu Kaka. Suma was
delighted at this praise, and ate her bhajias with great happiness all the way
home!

Five Spoons of Salt
One morning, Ajji told Ajja, ‘Today is a Santhe (a village market day which
happens once in a week). Why don’t you take the children and show them the
Santhe and buy vegetables and other things for the house?’ Ajja, who
normally would have said yes, was hesitant. ‘How will I manage all the
children, that too at the Santhe? Remember what happened at the jatre—the
fair? At least there they had a temporary police assistance booth. There will
be nothing of the sort at the Santhe.’ Ajji agreed. This was a problem. Then
she had an idea. ‘Why don’t we ask Vishnu if he can spare Damu for a few
hours? Damu can accompany you and help see that the children are all right.’
Damu was Vishnu Kaka’s right-hand man. Everyone called him ‘Mr
Dependable’. He drove the car, cooked, looked after the fields, the accounts
and made sure Vishnu Kaka was well cared for. Without him, Vishnu Kaka
could not run the house or do anything in the fields. Vishnu Kaka’s son lived
with his family in Delhi and came only for holidays, so Damu was his real
companion.
So it was that all seven children and Damu and Ajja were now ready to
visit the Santhe. Damu had a plan. ‘The Santhe is only two kilometres away.
Why don’t we walk, and let your Ajja go in the auto?’ The children were
horrified. Walk for two kilometres in the heat! ‘It would be so boring too!’
added Raghu. But Damu had made up his mind. ‘Walk with me. I will tell you
such wonderful stories that you will forget everything, even the heat!’
The children agreed. Then Meenu had a condition. ‘It has to be a true story,
Damu Anna!’

Damu was unfazed. ‘I’ll tell you a story about my sister. Do you know how
I came to be “Mr Dependable”? I saw what happened to her once because she
was forgetful and decided never to let that happen to me.’
So he started his story.
‘Gita, where are you? I need you to run down to the store and get these
medicines for me!’ Gita’s grandfather called out for her. Where was Gita? She
was lying in bed, reading a book! For a long time she pretended not to have
heard what her grandfather was saying. The book was just too exciting, and it
was so hot outside, she really did not feel like stirring out of bed.
‘Gita!’ This time her mother’s voice also called out to her. With a sigh, the
girl got out of bed and went to see what needed to be done. Her grandfather
handed her some money and said, ‘I have a really bad headache since
morning. Will you get these medicines for me?’
Gita took the money and set off for the store. On the way she passed by a
sweet shop. Oh, what lovely gulab jamoons and laddoos and jalebis were
displayed! She had to have some. Forgetting all about her errand she entered
the shop and started tucking into sweets. Soon a friend came by and joined
her. The two girls ate and chatted for a really long time. Gita had forgotten all
about her poor grandfather with his headache! Afternoon turned to evening,
the medicine store shut for the day, when Gita remembered why she had
stepped out of her house. When she hurried back home, how upset her
grandfather was. ‘When will you grow up, Gita, and become responsible?’ he
sighed and asked.


Gita felt really bad, but did she mend her ways? No, she remained the same
forgetful person. When her mother told her to collect the clothes from the
washing line outside, she remembered to do so only the next morning! By
then, the clothes were soaked through all over again because of the overnight
rains. Another day, she had to take her sister’s lunchbox to the school. On the
way she saw a circus was in town. All morning Gita spent wandering around
the circus tents, watching the animals eating and training for their acts. It was
only when she felt hungry herself did she look down at the lunchbox in her
hand and realized her sister must have gone home by then, after spending a
day in school without her lunch.
Another time her father, while rushing to get ready for work, asked if she
could quickly iron his shirt. Gita picked up the shirt and placed it on the
ironing table next to the window. Just then the fruit vendor passed by with
big, fat, juicy mangoes in his basket! Of course Gita forgot all about the hot
iron sitting on the shirt and got engrossed in choosing the best mangoes to
buy. Only when smoke started billowing out and the shirt had burnt as crisp as
a toast did she look around and see what had happened. Her father was very
upset indeed that day.
Some days after this incident, Gita came home from school and announced
that the whole class was being taken for a picnic the next day. The teacher had
asked each student to bring one food item from home which would be shared
by all the children. Gita had chosen to bring sambar. She was very proud of
her mother’s tasty, tangy sambar and was eager to share it with her friends so
they could taste it too. Gita’s mother agreed to make a big pot of sambar for
her to take to the picnic the next day, and that night Gita went to bed feeling
very happy, dreaming about the exciting day ahead.
The next morning, her mother woke up early and started making the
sambar. She boiled the dal, added the vegetables, coconut and all the spices,
and set the pot boiling on the stove. Soon a delicious aroma wafted out from
the pot and tickled Gita’s nose as she lay sleeping in bed. Seeing her stir, her
mother told her, ‘Gita wake up now, dear. See the sambar is nearly done. I am
going to the temple, so after some time just add five teaspoons of salt to it.
Don’t forget now, and wake up and get ready quickly!’
So saying she bustled off. Gita’s grandmother, who was in the kitchen,
heard all this and muttered to herself, ‘When will my daughter-in-law learn
that Gita can never remember anything. I’m sure the girl will forget to add the

salt. Then she will be teased by all her friends. Better be careful.’ So saying
she went and added the salt in the pot.
Gita’s grandfather was sitting on the veranda reading his newspaper. He
remembered only too well the day he had spent with a headache waiting for
Gita to return with the medicines which never came. ‘Gita and remember
something? That’ll be the day!’ he muttered, and went into the kitchen and
added the salt in the sambar himself.
Gita’s sister was combing her hair, ready to go off to school. She too
recalled the day she had spent feeling hungry in school waiting for Gita to
turn up with her lunchbox. Sure that Gita would forget about the salt and be
laughed at by her friends, she quickly went into the kitchen and added five
spoons of salt.
Gita’s brother was brushing his teeth and hearing his mother’s words to his
sister, guessed she would forget about the salt. He dropped in a few spoons of
salt into the pot and went off.
Gita’s father was carefully ironing his own shirt. Like the others he too
slipped into the kitchen and added salt to the pot of sambar.
By now Gita had woken up and wonder of wonders, remembered she
needed to add the salt! So she too went and added five teaspoons as her
mother had told her to do. By now her mother had returned and quickly
poured the sambar into a big container and sent her daughter off for her
picnic.
At the picnic spot the children had a wonderful time, roaming around and
playing. Soon they were too hungry to do anything else. Out came the plates
and spoons and all the containers filled to the brim with food. Plates were
piled up with rice, chutneys, vegetables, pooris and all kinds of goodies.
Everyone took large helpings of the sambar as Gita served it out. But no
sooner than they put the first spoonful in their mouths, ‘Blaagh! Horrible!
Water!’ everybody started shouting. Astonished, Gita wondered what was
wrong, then gingerly tasted the rice and sambar on her own plate. It was
disgusting! It was as if her mother had dredged out all the salt in the sea and
added it to the sambar! Then Gita remembered, her mother had not added the
salt, she had! So what had gone wrong?
That day everyone in Gita’s house waited eagerly for her to get back from
school and tell them about her wonderful outing. But what was this? She
came trudging back, her face sad and tear-stained. What had happened? Gita
burst out at them, ‘Did anyone else add salt in the sambar?’

‘I did!’ said her grandmother.
‘I did too!’ said Grandfather.
‘So did I!’ said Father.
‘Me too!’ said her brother.
‘And I!’ said her sister.
They all looked at each other in dismay. No wonder Gita looked so sad.
Her friends would have made her feel miserable about the salty sambar!
‘Why did you all do it? Amma had told only me to do so!’ Gita wept.
‘Oh dear, you forget everything you are told to do, so we thought . . .
perhaps . . . you wouldn’t remember this time too,’ all of them said sadly.
Now her mother pulled her close, wiped away her tears and said, ‘See, all
this happened because no one could believe you could do anything without
being reminded many times about it. Promise you will be a careful,
responsible girl from now on, and we will all trust you to do your work.’
Gita sniffed and nodded her head. She did become much more careful with
her chores after that. And it took a lot of convincing, but her friends did come
to her house for lunch one day to taste her mother’s delicious cooking,
especially her tasty, tangy sambar, and everyone agreed it was the best sambar
they had ever eaten!
When the story was over, the children realized they were already at the
Santhe. There were heaps of vegetables, sweets, flowers all around. There
were goats, cows, buffaloes, fish, chicken and eggs for sale. The smell of
nuts, cardamom and other spices hung in the air. It was unlike the fair where
people had come to have a good time. Here a lot of business was taking place
and everyone was buying and selling busily. The fruits and vegetables were
very fresh. The flowers looked as if they had just been plucked. Everyone was
friendly.
The fruit vendor saw Ajja and said, ‘Namaste Masterji. Oh! You have come
with your grandchildren. It is nice to see everyone like this.’ Then he gave
each one a mango. When Ajja offered money, he wouldn’t take it. He said,
‘After all you were my masterji, my teacher. Can’t I give seven mangoes as
gifts to your grandchildren? They are from my garden, not that I purchased
them.’ The children were delighted at his warmth and kindness and returned
home very happy that day.

How the Seasons Got Their Share
It was an unusually hot afternoon, and there was a power cut. The children
were sitting in the house, wiping their foreheads and complaining. ‘How do
you stay without electricity, Ajja?’ asked Raghu. ‘In Mumbai, in our
apartment, if ever the electricity goes off, the generator comes on
automatically. We never even know that the power has gone.’ Ajja looked
around at the hot, sweaty faces, and said, ‘All right, I’ll show you a place
which is as cool as an AC room. And it stays that way without any electricity!
Come on everyone, grab a mat each and follow me.’
The children were intrigued. Ajja walked out into the garden, crossed it,
right till the old neem tree that stood in a corner. Ajja told them to spread their
mats under the tree and lie down. It was deliciously cool and comfortable
under the tree. Everyone lay down and looked up at the gently moving leaves
on the great branches over their heads. This was so much more fun than lying
in a closed room! Ajja too had pulled up a comfortable old easy chair and was
nodding off. After some time he said, ‘This is why I love summer! What
seasons do you children prefer?’
Immediately Anand said, ‘I too like summer, because there is no school,
and we can eat ice cream and mangoes. We can also go swimming.’
‘I don’t like summer, I like winter. You can wear colourful sweaters and eat
different kinds of fruits. It is nice and cosy to be at home. You can drink hot
soup and hot chocolate,’ said Krishna.
‘I don’t like winter, I get ear pain. I prefer the rainy season. It is so nice
when it rains and all the trees look so fresh and happy,’ said Meenu.

‘What about you, Raghu? Why are you silent?’ Ajja asked.
‘I like all the seasons, provided someone like you or Ajji is there with us.’
Ajja smiled. ‘Well, each season has its own beauty and use. We could not
do without even one.’
‘How is that?’ asked the children.
‘Okay, I will tell you a story about what happened once when the seasons
starting fighting with one another.’
God stepped back and looked happily at the Earth he had just created. He had
filled it with humans, animals, trees and seas and it looked a wonderful place
to be in. But something was missing. After thinking for a while, he called out
to six brothers: Day, Night, Summer, Winter, Monsoon and Wind. He
commanded the six brothers to go down to Earth and help the creatures there
live comfortably and prosper. ‘You must help the creatures on Earth grow
food and live comfortably. I have divided Time into two parts—twenty-four
hours and 365 days. You must share this among yourselves so that people on
Earth get all that they need.’ The six brothers nodded obediently, but no
sooner was God’s back turned than they all started quarrelling!
Everyone wanted a big share of the time available to spend on Earth. Day
and Night decided each would get twenty-four hours each. But the seasons
kept quarrelling. Summer was the eldest, so he said, ‘I will be on Earth for
365 days first!’


Rain said, ‘If I don’t show up all the water on Earth will disappear, so I will
come next.’
Winter said, ‘After the rains I help trees to flower, so I will come in the
third year.’
Poor Wind was the youngest and no one paid him any attention, so he got
the last year.
So life started on Earth. For twenty-four hours at a time there was Day,
then twenty-four hours of Night. Summer continued for one whole year.
While in the beginning the heat helped the crops to grow, soon it became too
hot for anyone to do anything. All the water dried up and there was great
discomfort. The people of Earth pleaded with Summer to stop and he had to
leave before his year was up.
Then it was the turn of Rain. When he started pouring down, how happy
everyone was to get some respite from the year’s summer. But soon the lakes,
ponds, rivers, oceans all filled to the brim and started overflowing. The crops
got spoilt in the rain and there was nothing for anyone to eat. When people
prayed for him to stop, he had to step aside and make way for Winter.
With relief people greeted Winter. Now there was neither the scorching sun
nor the pouring rain. But when day after day went by like this they started
falling sick from the constant cold, the plants started dying because of less
sunshine. At the people’s request Winter too had to stop.
Now it was the turn of Wind. Within a few days of his constant huffing and
puffing people were scared to step out anywhere. Trees were uprooted, the
roofs of houses went flying and there was chaos all around.
The brothers realized what they had done would displease God mightily. So
they decided to change their ways. Instead of each taking a year they decided
to share one year among each other. But again, Wind being the youngest got
left out and got no time for himself. He sat in a corner and sulked.
During summer time people sowed their crops and waited for the rains.
Rain came with loads of water but there was no wind to distribute it equally.
Some parts of Earth got buckets of rain and other parts none at all. Now
everyone realized that Wind was as important. They called out to him and he
finally agreed to do his work. But he did not get a separate time for himself.
He was allowed to blow all through the year. So in Summer he blew and
helped reduce the heat. During rains he blew the clouds from one place to
another and took rainwater everywhere. In Winter he still blew and made it
even colder!

Day and Night too learnt from the four brothers and decided to divide the
twenty-four hours equally. So one half was Day and the other was Night.
Now everyone on Earth was happy, and the six brothers learnt to share their
time.
By this time Ajji called from the house, ‘The electricity is back. You can
come inside now.’ But the children were happy to remain outside and enjoy
the breeze.

The Island of Statues
One day, early in the morning, the children heard a loud voice booming
outside. ‘Where are your grandchildren? I have come to take them to my
place.’ They went running out to see a very tall man with twinkling eyes and a
grey beard sipping coffee with their grandparents. He wore a crisp white dhoti
and shirt and a black cap. His smile was so charming that the children
instantly warmed to him. Ajji was shaking her head and saying, ‘Rehmat,
there’s no way Peerambhi can manage four children. Take them out for the
day, why do you want to have them over for the night?’ But the man called
Rehmat shook his head. ‘No no, I will take them for a night’s stay. My Usman
is a great cook and will look after everything. Peerambhi will not be troubled
at all.’
Ajji saw the questioning look on the children’s faces and explained, ‘This is
Rehmat. A long time back when your Ajja was a schoolteacher, he was your
Ajja’s student. He lives a little far away now. He has a mango grove there,
and a large house. All his children live abroad. In his house there’s a large
library of books and what can be called a mini zoo with goats, cows,
peacocks, pigeons and parrots. He wants to have you all over for the night.
I’m sure you’ll have a good time, but do you want to go?’
‘He also tells very beautiful stories,’ added Ajja.
Rehmat grinned and said, ‘Masterji, don’t exaggerate. I started reading
children’s storybooks only after my grandchildren were born. Then I
remembered the stories you used to tell us in school and passed off some of

them as my own.’ He turned to the children and said, ‘So what do you think,
kids, will you come with me? I will show you a different part of the village.’
Everyone was thinking, when Raghu spoke up, ‘Can we bring our friends
with us?’
‘Oh, you mean Vishnu Kaka’s grandchildren? Of course they can come.
The more the merrier. Peerambhi will love having so many children in the
house.’
Raghu ran to Sharan’s house to give the news.
Rehmat Chacha, as everyone called him, had brought a jeep and soon all
seven had packed a change and their toothbrushes and piled into it. Rehmat
Chacha’s house was far, about thirty kilometres away, and on the way they
had to go through a forest. The road cutting through the forest was narrow and
winding. Tall trees stood on both sides. It was a dark, scary place. Suma
looked around nervously and said, ‘Will anyone ever cut down these trees and
widen the road?’
Rehamt Chacha shook his head. ‘Oh no, the villagers will never allow it.
We love our trees and try to see as few are cut down as possible. Trees must
never be cut unnecessarily. Do you want to listen to a story about a kingdom
that cut down all its trees?’
Of course the children did, so Rehmat Chacha began his story.
Once there was a beautiful verdant green island. It had forests filled with huge
trees, waterfalls gushing with clear blue water and mountains where there was
a quarry of a unique kind of stone. This stone was valued for its attractive
white colour. It was also easy to turn into sculptures.
The island had been ruled for years by a king who was now old. He looked
after his people well and loved the natural beauty of his land above all. His
closest friend was a sculptor called Amar. Amar too loved the land more than
anything else. He had a school where students from far and wide came to
learn the art of creating sculptures out of stone. But Amar had one odd
condition for the students who studied in his school. He insisted they bring
their own supply of stone! Only for their final sculpture were they allowed to
use a piece of stone from the island’s quarry. Many grumbled at this rule.
After all, dragging tons of stone to an island in the middle of a sea was
difficult, but Amar was adamant.

Once his king asked him the reason for this condition, and this is what wise
old Amar had to say: ‘This stone and indeed everything on this remarkable
land of ours is a gift which we need to preserve. Unless we use it wisely how
will we be able to save this quarry for our children? If we start using the
stones and woods from trees without a thought they will soon finish and then
we will be left with an empty, barren land. This is why I insist that students
learning the craft of sculpting bring their own material, and only when they
make their final piece of art can they use this unique stone from our land.’
The king applauded this thought in his mind and let Amar run his school
the way he wanted. But then a day came when the king, now very old, died,
and his son took over the throne. Rajdip, the new king, wanted to do
everything differently from his father. He started changing many laws. One
day he remembered the art school and went to visit it. There he saw the
students working on their sculptures. But his ministers whispered to him the
complaints that other students, who had not wanted to bring their own
material, had made about Amar’s rule.
Rajdip realized that if he lifted the rule then many more people would come
to study in the school. Their fees would add to the prosperity of the island and
in addition they would create lovely works of art that could be used to
beautify the towns. He ordered Amar to step down as the teacher and brought
someone else to run the school.
Soon the island was full of students chipping away on the stone. Their
demands increased the mining at the quarry. They created large sculptures
which now needed to get transported back to the town. Trees were cut down
to make carts and to clear roads. Without trees to provide wood for their boats
the fishermen of the island could not go out to sea. They started fishing near
the land and got into fights frequently with one another. New houses were not
strong as both wood and stone were scarce. It was difficult for farmers to
make good ploughs and so farming suffered. All the mining created so much
of pollution that plants started dying out, diseases spread, and the tinkling
waterfalls fell silent as water became scarce. The climate changed, it became
hotter and drier. Soon there were famines and the once beautiful green island
was reduced to a wasteland of weeds and scrub.
Rajdip’s wishes of lining his capital city and palace with giant sculptures
was fulfilled. Each student in the art school made a beautiful huge statue and
gifted it to him. Soon these statues filled up the entire kingdom. Where once
there were deep forests and blue rivers and streams, the island was a barren

land now. The forests were gone. The rivers had turned into dirty trickles of
water. The climate had become hot and dusty as the rains no longer came on
time. People started leaving the island. The houses, schools and palaces
slowly fell silent as they were abandoned. With time, everyone forgot about
this island. Many, many years later when explorers landed here, they found
hundreds of statues strewn all over a bare island: a land destroyed by the
king’s greed.


How everyone enjoyed the story. The rest of the journey was spent in each
one acting out a part from the story, with Rehmat Chacha taking on the role of
the wise old king. Cheerful and at the same time very hungry, they soon
reached their new friend’s house.
It was a huge rambling place. Peerambhi was waiting for them at the
doorstep. She told Usman to make a sherbet of mango, and Shurukumbha (a
kind of kheer) for lunch. There was also paratha, biriyani, and all kinds of
mouth-watering dishes which Usman was more than happy to prepare. After
lunch they roamed around the house, examined the books in the library and
the many awards Rehmat Chacha had received for his innovative skills in
agriculture.

The Kingdom of Fools
‘Rehmat Chacha, you must be very intelligent. You know so much about
farming, fishing, stories and so many other things,’ Meenu remarked that
night as they sat outside, watching the fireflies twinkling all around them.
But Rehmat Chacha did not agree. ‘No, not really. There is plenty I still
don’t know. In fact, one can never stop learning. Knowledge is the only thing
it’s good to be greedy about.’
It was a beautiful, clear night. The moon and stars shone in the black,
unpolluted sky. Peerambhi was feeling very happy. Her own grandchildren
lived so far away, and came to visit her only once in two or three years. After
so long the house was filled with laughter and young voices. She was too frail
to do much, and was enjoying sitting among them and talking to them.
Soon they started yawning and rubbing their eyes. But no one was going to
bed till Rehmat Chacha told another story!
There once lived a king who was very intelligent. He looked down upon
anyone he thought was dull. He was also very proud about the fact that in his
kingdom there were no stupid people.
Some distance away from the capital city lived an old teacher. He had
taught the young prince, who was a sweet-natured boy once but had turned
into a proud, rude king. Many people told him about the king’s boastful
nature, and the teacher decided to teach his old pupil a lesson he would never
forget. He called his three best and brightest students, Harish, Mahesh and

Umesh, and said, ‘We need to bring that proud king down a peg or two. I
want the three of you to teach him a lesson and make him realize the
foolishness of his pride.’
The three students set off for the capital. Harish walked to the city market.
There he met a man selling betel leaves.
‘How much for these leaves?’ he asked.
‘Ten rupees for two hundred leaves,’ the shopkeeper replied.
‘Here are ten rupees. Give me only twenty-five leaves. My servant will
come and collect the balance one hundred and seventy-five leaves.’
The betel-leaf seller agreed and gave Harish twenty-five leaves.
Harish now strolled into another shop where beautiful shawls were being
sold.
‘How much for this?’ he asked, fingering the best shawl in the shop.
‘Two hundred rupees,’ answered the shopkeeper.
‘Here are twenty-five rupees. You can collect the remaining hundred and
seventy-five rupees from the paan shop there,’ Harish said, handing the
shopkeeper a note.
‘Please give the person who brings this note the remaining one hundred and
seventy-five,’ the note read. The shawl shop owner sent his servant with the
note to the paan shop to verify if indeed this was true. The other shopkeeper
glanced at the note and said, ‘Yes, it’s true. I have to give him one hundred
and seventy-five more. Come back in half an hour—I will count and keep
them ready.’
The servant returned and whispered to his master: indeed, the betel-leaf
seller was going to give them the remaining one hundred and seventy-five.
Harish walked out with the shawl. After half an hour, when the servant went
to collect the money, he found the shopkeeper busy counting out leaves.
‘Hundred seventy-three, hundred seventy-four, hundred seventy-five . . .
There you go, here are the rest of the leaves.’
The servant was amazed at being handed a sheaf of paan leaves instead of
money. He called his master and the two shopkeepers started arguing loudly.
Slowly they realized that someone had made fools of them. They rushed to
complain to the king.
The king was surprised to hear how a stranger had tricked the clever
shopkeepers of his kingdom. He decided to keep a lookout for this man.
The next day, Mahesh walked into the royal carpenter’s shop. It was the
middle of the afternoon and the carpenter was in his shop tinkering with some

strange-looking instruments. Mahesh was well dressed, so the carpenter
thought he was rich. Enthusiastically he started showing off his various
creations. He picked up a large wooden lock and said, ‘See this? Will you
believe that with this you can even lock a man? Place the person’s head
between the lock and a pillar and turn the key, and there, the man cannot
escape.’
Mahesh pretended to be sceptical. ‘Go on now. How can a simple wooden
lock do such a thing? I don’t believe you.’ The carpenter got very agitated.
‘But it’s true, sir. I am the king’s carpenter after all. I create many complicated
instruments for the state. Here, let me show you.’ Saying this, he put the lock
around his neck and the nearest pillar and turned the key. ‘Now, see? I cannot
even move my neck! Are you convinced? Now just turn the key the other way
to set me free.’
But Mahesh would not turn the key. He just stood there laughing. Then he
coolly picked up the key and walked out of the shop. The carpenter could
only shout at Mahesh’s retreating back. ‘You villain! Come back! Set me
free!’ But it was in vain. Mahesh had fooled him.
Later that evening the king came to know of this other stranger who had
duped his clever carpenter. He was worried. Who were these men, making the
brightest people of his kingdom look stupid? He decided to go around the city
in disguise to try and catch them.
As he walked near the city gates, he found a man sitting there with a heap
of mangoes, waiting for someone to buy them. The fruit seller had chosen the
loneliest spot, so the king was suspicious.
‘Why are you selling your fruits here?’ he asked.
The fruit seller was actually Umesh. He pretended to look nervously
around and answered in a whisper, ‘Sir, I have heard there are some clever
cheats roaming around the kingdom wanting to cheat us and our clever king. I
have heard one will be walking by this way soon, so I am waiting here hoping
to catch him and deliver him to the king.’
The king was surprised that this person knew all about the clever gang of
cheats.
‘Have you seen him before?’
‘Yes, sir. I know the gang. The person who is coming today is the chief.’
‘What does he look like?’
‘He is tall, hefty and very cruel.’
‘Is there any way I can see him?’ the king asked excitedly.

‘Sir, the best way is to hide. As soon as he comes, I will whistle, and you
can see him.’
But at that spot there was neither a tree nor any rock behind which the king
could hide. Then the fruit seller held out a sack. ‘Hide in this, sir,’ he
suggested. ‘I will keep you next to me, and anyone will think it is a sack of
mangoes.’


The king agreed and hopped into the sack. Quickly Umesh tied it and
walked away, laughing. The king soon realized he had been tricked. But he
was tied in the sack and could do nothing. Many hours later, when his soldiers
came looking for him, he managed to wriggle around in the sack and attract
their attention. How embarrassed he was, to be set free by them! He also
knew now that he and the people of his kingdom were not as clever as he
loved to boast. He realized his mistake.
The king’s old teacher came to the court and explained how his three
students had tricked everyone. Harish, Mahesh and Umesh apologized for
their actions. And the king promised to rule his kingdom with wisdom and
humility.

The Story of Silk
No sooner had the children gotten over their excitement of the visit to Rehmat
Chacha’s house than Ajji sprung another surprise. There was a wedding in the
village! Having attended some village weddings earlier, the children knew
what to expect. Here, it was not like the city where you went at a certain time
printed on the card, gave your present, ate and came back. In the village,
everyone was invited, whether your name was on a card or not. And not only
were you expected to come as early as possible, you were also expected to
pitch in and help the host! So Damu was seen rushing off in the jeep to pick
up guests from the railway station. Rehmat Chacha was in charge of
providing fresh vegetables from his farm. Ajji was herding a group of women
into the kitchen and telling them what to do. Ajja was supervising the
cleanliness and had stocked up on big bottles of phenyl and other cleansers.
And Vishnu Kaka was dressed in his best, most spotless dhoti and kurta and
was looking after the guests.
Ajji told the children to wear their nicest clothes and come to the venue.
Krishna, always careful of the way she looked, wore her pretty blue silk
frock. Ajji noticed and said, ‘Krishna, remember to be careful. There will be a
lot of people and food there. Don’t get your clothes dirty.’
Krishna promised to be careful. Soon Ajji disappeared into the kitchen
which was lined with people chopping and stirring and cooking. Outside,
guests were pouring in and Vishnu Kaka was making sure everyone was
served breakfast. Ajja was seen hurrying about with a bottle of phenyl in his
hand. Rehmat Chacha was taking care of the flower decorations while

Peerambhi Chachi was stringing piles of garlands. Children were playing all
over the place, film songs played on the mike and there was a happy chaos
everywhere.
After the wedding, during lunch time, while eating sweet pancakes of
chiroti with badam milk, someone jostled Krishna and a big puddle of milk
fell on her dress. She was grief-striken. Ajji consoled her. ‘Don’t cry. Silk can
be washed and made to look just like new. That is the wonderful thing about
it.’ Seeing Krishna’s tear-stained face she said, ‘Today when we go home I
will tell you the story of how silk was made for the first time.’ That made
Krishna happy. That night, though Ajji was tired, she still told the children the
story of silk.
Did you know that silk was discovered in China?
A long time ago, in a tiny village in China, there lived a poor girl belonging
to a weaver’s family. One day, the emperor was passing through the village
and saw her working in the fields. He noticed her red cheeks and rosebud-like
mouth, her proud bearing and her rough, work-worn hands, which meant she
worked very hard through the year. He immediately fell in love with her and
though he was much older, decided to marry her.
The girl married the ruler of the land and went to live in his palace as his
beloved queen. But she was unhappy. She had grown up in the wide open
spaces of the countryside, and now she was confined to a palace, magnificent
though it was. She was used to working from dawn to night without a
moment’s rest, but now she had many servants to take care of her needs and
did not know how to fill her time. In the village she had been surrounded by
family and friends who exchanged news and gossip as they worked, but in the
palace it was quiet and no one spoke out of turn. The emperor noticed his new
wife was sad and tried his best to make her happy. He bought her grand
clothes, jewels and artefacts, threw elaborate parties, hired the best musicians
of the land to amuse her. Yet she was sad.
One afternoon, the empress sat under a mulberry bush in her garden, lost in
her thoughts about her village. She slowly sipped hot water from a cup.
Staring up at the blue sky, the girl remembered the birds that flew over her
village. Then, sighing softly to herself, she picked up her cup to take another
sip. But what was this! A cocoon from the mulberry bush had dropped into
the hot water! Her first thought was to throw away the water and the cocoon.

But then she took a closer look, and she saw some threads peeping out from
the cocoon. Where had they come from? She pulled the threads. They were
thin, strong and shiny. She kept pulling and a long line of thread came out.
Now the empress had a great idea. She would take the thread from many
cocoons and weave soft, strong cloth from it!


She called her servants and everyone got to work. They took cocoons out
of the mulberry tree, dropped them in hot water, and removed the thread.
They gathered a fair amount of yarn. Then the queen ordered a special
weaving machine and wove the first piece of cloth using this new thread.
Thus silk, the best and brightest form of cloth, was weaved.
The manufacture of silk spread throughout China. It was the cloth that only
royalty could wear, and was much in demand in lands as far away as Rome.
The route through which silk was traded between China and Europe through
Asia was called the Silk Route.
Now that the Chinese had learnt how to make silk cloth, they did not want
to share this knowledge with anyone in the world. Generations of Chinese
royalty were sworn never to reveal the secret to anyone. When princesses got
married and went away to far-off lands, they were not allowed to tell anyone
in their new home how silk was made.
Many, many years later, when a clever princess was leaving her house on
getting married, as was the custom, her bags were searched carefully to check
that she did not carry anything that would help her make silk. This princess
had been weaving silk from a young age and wanted to continue to do so
wherever she went. She had hidden the cocoons in her long, elaborate hairdo.
No one thought of looking there! When she went to her husband’s house, she
took out these cocoons from her hair and started gathering silk thread! In this
way, legend goes, the knowledge of how to make silk left China.

When Yama Called
One day, Ajji was sitting and stitching a tear in an old sari. The children came
and sat around her. The holidays were finishing and they did not want to be
away from her for even a minute. Meenu and Krishna affectionately put their
arms around Ajji’s neck and said, ‘Ajji, why do you have so many wrinkles
on your hand?’
‘Because I am old,’ said Ajji.
‘Why do old people have wrinkles?’ asked Meenu.
Ajji took off her glasses, which she wore only when sewing or reading, and
said, ‘Once upon a time I was also young like you. My skin was smooth and
shiny. My hair was long and black. I had very sharp eyes and an excellent
memory. But as I grew older, everything changed slowly.’
‘We will all grow old like this one day, shan’t we?’ asked Divya.
‘Yes, every living being gets old. It is a part of life. Come, I will tell you a
story about old age.’
Many, many years ago, there lived, in a little town, a man named Arun. He
was a merchant and though not very rich, he lived comfortably enough. He
had a large family of brothers, sisters, wife and children. He looked after them
well, and in whatever way he could, he also helped out the poor people in the
town. He built rest houses for travellers, and in these there were dining halls
where anyone could come and have a good, wholesome meal for very little
money.

One day, while returning home from work, he happened to pass by one
such rest house. It had a veranda where people stopped and rested. Sitting
there, looking tired and hungry, was a stranger. He was a tall man. His clothes
were travel-stained and showed that he had come from afar. With him was his
horse, looking as tired and hungry as its master.
Seeing them, Arun’s kind heart melted, and he went up to speak to the man.
‘Where have you come from, my brother?’ he asked. ‘Why don’t you step
inside for a hot meal and some rest?’
The man looked up, gave a smile and said, ‘The rest house is very popular.
There is no room for me, and the dining hall is full too. I will wait here for a
while, then be on my way. I’m sure I will find another place to serve me some
food down the road.’
Arun would not hear of this. The thought that someone was going away
without food and rest was too much for him. He insisted on the man coming
back to his house with him. There he invited the traveller to share a meal with
his family. The man was served lovingly and ate his fill.
While he sat eating, the man noticed that Arun was sometimes a bit absent-
minded. It was as if something was on his mind, and he was worried. Once
they had finished eating and had washed up, the traveller rose to leave. He
thanked Arun for his kindness, then said, ‘If you don’t mind me asking, sir, I
could not help but notice that you were a bit worried. I know I am a stranger
to you, but perhaps it would help lighten your burden if you shared your
worries with me.’
But Arun only smiled and shook his head. He did not want to share his
thoughts with the stranger.
Then the man said, ‘Perhaps if I show you who I really am you will confide
in me.’
And in a trice the man changed. He was no longer a tired traveller, but a
god, resplendent in shimmering clothes with a crown on his head. His horse
changed into a buffalo, and the man introduced himself, ‘I am Yama, the lord
of death. Now will you tell me what’s wrong?’
Seeing this Arun nearly fainted. The lord of death had just shared a meal
with him! ‘Wh-what are you doing on earth, my lord?’ he gasped.
Yama smiled and said, ‘Oh, I like coming here once in a while, and seeing
what everyone is doing. So, what’s bothering you?’
Arun replied, ‘You see, I need to grow my business more, but today I was
not feeling very well. If anything happened to me, who would look after my

large family?’
Yama nodded seriously. ‘Don’t worry, child,’ he comforted. ‘I have seen
what a hard-working, kind- hearted person you are. You invited me home and
let me have a meal with you, knowing me only to be a tired and weary
traveller. I will do one thing. when it is time for you to leave the earth and
come with me, like all living things have to do one day, I will not come all of
a sudden. I will let you know many days in advance, so you can prepare
yourself and your affairs for the time you have to go away with me.’
Arun bowed to the lord in gratitude when he heard this and Yama vanished.
Years went by. Arun became an old man. His business had grown many
times over, his children and brothers and sisters were all well looked after. He
had few worries left.
One night, he went to bed and had a dream. He saw Yama standing in front
of him. Yama was holding out a hand towards him and saying, ‘Come, it is
time for you to go away with me.’
Arun was terrified. ‘But lord, you had promised you would tell me days in
advance before I would die. How can I come away right now?’
A small smile appeared on Yama’s lips. ‘But child, I did give you a
warning. I made your hair turn white, I made your back stoop with age, I
made your teeth fall out one by one. These were all indications that your time
on earth is coming to an end.’
‘But these things happen to every man and woman! How could these be a
warning only for me!’
Yama nodded, ‘Yes, they do happen to everyone. And when they do, men
and women should start getting ready to meet me. Life has to come to an end,
there is no escape.’


Arun now understood. He looked back on his days and realized that even
without meaning to, he had been preparing for this. His children looked after
his business, all his work was done. There was nothing stopping him from
going away with his old friend Yama.
He climbed on the buffalo behind Yama. ‘Let’s go,’ he said. And off Yama
went away with him.

The Unending Story
Today Ajja, Ajji and Vishnu Kaka were all feeling sad. The children’s
holidays were nearly over, and it was nearing the time when they would go
back to their homes. For three weeks the houses had echoed with their
laughter, games and quarrels. Now all would be quiet once again, till they
returned for the next holiday. The children too were feeling sad, and had
gathered around their grandparents in a tight little group. Raghu the eldest
said, ‘We had more fun this holiday then we’ve ever had. Even more than
when we visited Disneyland. And it was all because of the stories.’
Ajja said, ‘When I was still working as a schoolteacher, I always found it
was so much easier to get my students’ attention when I told the lessons in the
form of stories.’
Anand said, ‘I find it really boring to read history from a book. But if you
tell us the stories from history I’m sure we will remember everything!’
Everyone now turned their bright eyes on Ajji. ‘How can you tell us only
one story even on this last day, Ajji! We want more!’ they clamoured.
But Ajji shook her head. ‘If you eat only pickles and laddoos will you be
healthy? Stories are like that. You can’t spend all your time listening to
stories. Then it will be boring. Like the unending story that a king once had to
hear.’
‘I want a story! And that’s an order!’ shouted King Pratap Singh of
Mayanagar. King Pratap was only fifteen years old, and still a boy at heart. He

didn’t like being a king much, because he was supposed to be doing serious
things like keeping the law, listening to his people’s problems and all kinds of
dreary things like that. The only part he liked about being a ruler was that
everyone had to obey him! How he loved giving orders and making all kinds
of demands. And what he loved the most was listening to stories! Every day,
he insisted on listening to at least ten stories. All the storytellers in his
kingdom lined up at his court. They told him funny stories, scary stories,
magical stories and anything else that came to their mind. King Pratap
listened to all with rapt attention.
He loved stories and storytellers so much that whenever he heard a good
tale he would shower the teller with gold, silver and all kinds of wonderful
presents. His ministers sighed and shook their heads and tried to explain,
‘Your Majesty, stories are all very well, but you should be listening to them
after your work is done! Your people need you to do so many things for them.
If you spend all your time wrapped up in fantasies, how will the land
prosper?’
But King Pratap paid no attention. It was stories he wanted, and stories he
would get. But how long could the people provide him with stories? Soon the
tales began to dry out. Some tried to cleverly tell him ones they had related
long back, but Pratap was sharp as a needle. ‘I’ve heard that one! Off with his
head for repeating a story!’
Oh, how his ministers had to plead with him to pardon the culprits!
Finally, disgusted with all the storytellers in his land, the king announced,
‘I want someone to tell me a story that will go on and on, till I ask him to
stop. Anyone who can do this will get half my kingdom as a prize!’
His ministers were even more horrified at this. Half the kingdom to some
woolly-headed writer and teller of stories! How horrible! They all tried to
show the king the foolishness of his ways, but he was adamant. A story that
lasted for days, even weeks, was what he wanted and that was that!
Soon a long line of men and women appeared at his court. Each one wanted
to win the big prize. But none of their stories were good enough for King
Pratap.
‘Boring!’ he shouted at some.
‘Rubbish!’ he yelled at others.
‘Cock and bull!’ he bellowed at yet others.
Meanwhile work on the kingdom’s affairs had come to a stop. All the
ministers were sitting wringing their hands and wondering how to bring back

their king to solving all the important issues. Finally the chief minister, who
was wise and clever, had an idea.
The next day, a scruffy, crazy-looking man turned up at the court. His hair
was in a mess, his clothes were half torn and on his feet he wore torn shoes
from which his toes stuck out. He marched up to the palace and demanded to
be given an audience with the king. The guards sighed and let him in. They
were used to having all kinds of characters turning up at the gates wanting to
tell stories to the king.
The old man was admitted into the king’s chamber. There he made himself
comfortable, drank a huge jug of water, and without introducing himself,
started his story:
‘This story begins in a humble farmer’s field. The farmer had toiled days
and weeks and months and grown a bumper crop of sugar cane. He sold the
sugar cane to the nearby sugar factory and they made sacks and sacks of sugar
out of it. Everyone was so happy. All this sugar would be sold in the markets
and make everyone very rich! That year their children would get nice new
clothes, their stores would be full of food and their wives would be very
happy with them!
‘Now all that sugar had to be stored and kept carefully till the sacks could
be taken to the market to sell. The factory people poured the sugar into many
sacks and lugged them into a storeroom. In the storeroom who would you
find, but a colony of ants. They had decided that building their house near
such a ready supply of their favourite food was a very good idea, and were
always on the lookout for new batches of sugar to be stored there.
‘No sooner had the sacks been kept than the lines of ants marched up to
them. They found little holes to make their way in and the first ant went into
the first bag of sugar, took one sugar crystal and went back.
‘The next ant went into the bag and took a crystal and returned home.
‘Another went into the bag and took a crystal and returned home.
‘Yet another went into the bag and took a crystal and returned home . . .’
So on and on the storyteller droned. King Pratap found he had nearly dozed
off, the day had passed by and he was still listening to the same story.
‘Stop! Stop!’ he ordered. ‘I will listen to the rest of the story tomorrow.’
The next morning the old man turned up as usual and started from where he
had left off the previous day. ‘Yesterday I was telling you how the ants came
and picked up the sugar crystals. Now the next ant went towards the bag of

sugar and took a crystal and went back home. Another went and took a sugar
crystal and returned home. Another ant . . .’
The story went on and on like this. Lunch and dinner passed by but nothing
new happened. By now King Pratap was bursting with rage. How dare anyone
tell him such a boring story? ‘What kind of a story is this?’ he complained.
‘What will happen next? What happened to the farmer?’


But the old man only smiled and said, ‘Have patience, Your Majesty. That
year the yield was very good and there were thousands of bags of sugar. I
have to tell you how the ants collected all the sugar.’
‘Oh stop! Stop!’ Pratap shouted. ‘Stop this boring story at once!’
The man now stood up and said, ‘Fine, if you are ordering me to stop, I
have won the prize. Give me half your kingdom!’
The king was in a dilemma now. He had announced a competition and
prize no doubt, but could he honestly give away half the kingdom to this
crazy-looking storyteller with his boring tales?
As he sat pondering, the man grinned even wider, and took off his dirty
robe, rubbed off the dirt from his face and shook back his shaggy white hair.
Everyone was astonished. Why, this was the chief minister himself!
‘Don’t worry, Your Majesty,’ the minister told his overjoyed king. ‘I did not
want half your kingdom. I only wanted to show you how you were wrong to
neglect your work and listen to stories night and day. Your people deserve a
good king, someone who will work hard to look after them; someone who
will think of his own happiness only once his people are happy. That’s what
good kings do, you know. Not just giving orders and enjoying yourself.’
Poor Pratap looked ashamed at this. Yes, he had been an extremely selfish
king. From now on, story time was only at night, after all his work was done.
So that was how the summer holidays ended. Everyone packed their bags and
reached the station. Their mothers had come to take them back home. Ajja,
Ajji, Vishnu Kaka, Damu, Rehmat Chacha—everyone had come to see them
off. No one felt like leaving Ajji’s side and Meenu kept hugging her till she
had to board the train.
Soon the train puffed out of the station. The children leaned out to wave
their goodbyes. Slowly Shiggaon got left behind. But the children would
continue to remember their Ajja and Ajji and everyone else, and all the
stories, which would remain with them forever. And they would be back,
during the next summer holidays, when they would hear so many more . . .
