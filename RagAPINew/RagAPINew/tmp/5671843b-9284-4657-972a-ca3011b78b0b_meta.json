He said to Ajja, \u2018I wonder\nhow birds decide where and how to make their nests!\u2019 Ajja said, \u2018The straw in\nthe nest is from the paddy field. Do you know, farming helps human beings as\nwell as birds?\u2019 Krishna replied, \u2018Ajja, I thought wheat and rice can be just\nplucked from trees, like mangoes.

The children\u2019s\nholidays were nearly over, and it was nearing the time when they would go\nback to their homes. For three weeks the houses had echoed with their\nlaughter, games and quarrels. Now all would be quiet once again, till they\nreturned for the next holiday. The children too were feeling sad, and had\ngathered around their grandparents in a tight little group. Raghu the eldest\nsaid, \u2018We had more fun this holiday then we\u2019ve ever had. Even more than\nwhen we visited Disneyland. And it was all because of the stories.\u2019\nAjja said, \u2018When I was still working as a schoolteacher, I always found it\nwas so much easier to get my students\u2019 attention when I told the lessons in the\nform of stories.\u2019\nAnand said, \u2018I find it really boring to read history from a book. But if you\ntell us the stories from history I\u2019m sure we will remember everything!\u2019\nEveryone now turned their bright eyes on Ajji. \u2018How can you tell us only",

You can\u2019t spend all your time listening to\nstories. Then it will be boring. Like the unending story that a king once had to\nhear.\u2019\n\u2018I want a story!

Every day,\nhe insisted on listening to at least ten stories. All the storytellers in his\nkingdom lined up at his court. They told him funny stories, scary stories,\nmagical stories and anything else that came to their mind. King Pratap\nlistened to all with rapt attention.\nHe loved stories and storytellers so much that whenever he heard a good\ntale he would shower the teller with gold, silver and all kinds of wonderful\npresents.

Off with his\nhead for repeating a story!\u2019\nOh, how his ministers had to plead with him to pardon the culprits!\nFinally, disgusted with all the storytellers in his land, the king announced,\n\u2018I want someone to tell me a story that will go on and on, till I ask him to\nstop.
