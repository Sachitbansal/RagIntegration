This branch is ideal for students who are undecided about their career path and wish to explore various engineering domains before making a choice. In the first two years, the program promotes interdisciplinary learning, allowing students to delve into mechanical topics (mechanics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics), electrical topics (semiconductor electronics, digital systems, signal processing), and software fields (data science, machine learning, deep learning). Students graduate with a B.Tech in General Engineering with Specialisation in [ABC], where ABC refers to one of the available specialisations: Robotics & AI, Mechatronics, Finance Management, or Communications. These begin in the third year and include focused coursework in the chosen area. An additional option, called Open Specialisation, allows students to study from a set of electives across various domains. However, this",
