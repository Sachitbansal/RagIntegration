The Uncharted Path: Why Curiosity is Your Greatest Compass
(Opening: Walk onto stage with confidence, a warm smile, and a sense of humble excitement. Pause, take a breath, and make eye contact with the audience.)
Good afternoon, everyone! It’s truly an honor to be here at this prestigious TEDx event, sharing this stage with so many brilliant minds. Looking out at all of you, I see a room full of potential, of dreams, and of futures waiting to be written. And today, I want to talk about writing your own.
You know, when I was growing up, I wasn't just a kid who loved video games or cartoons. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed those too! But what truly lit a fire in me was curiosity. That insatiable urge to know "how" and "why." In 4th grade, I picked up a Rubik's Cube. What started as a puzzling toy quickly became an obsession. I learned the algorithms, practiced relentlessly, and soon, I could solve it in under 30 seconds. But I didn't stop there; I moved on to much more complex versions like mirror cube, gear cube, megaminx, pyramix, ghost cube, always pushing the boundaries of what I could achieve. It wasn't about grades or accolades then; it was about the pure joy of discovery and mastering a challenge.
This burning curiosity led me down a path that, to many, might have seemed a little unconventional, especially for someone my age. When I was just in 9th grade, while many of my friends were focussed on solving maths quadratic equations or cramming russian revolution for 5 more marks in that SST test, I was diving headfirst into the world of tech. I started learning Python, Web Development then App Development, and then a whole host of other enabling tools. Why? Because I wanted to build something. I wanted to see my ideas come to life. And that quest, that unwavering pursuit of a passion, became my guiding star.
And here’s where it gets interesting: I wasn't just learning for the sake of it. I was learning to create. To solve problems. To innovate. At under 16, I remember the thrill of making my first Android app live. It was about bridging a gap in real estate agents and buyers, a platform for it, I know it existed already, but it was about creating something from what i know and deploying it to the world out there. The feeling of seeing something I had built, something that was entirely my own, accessible to others – that was a powerful validation. Every step, every late night, every challenge wasn't just about gaining a skill; it was about the tangible impact I could create, the problems I could solve, and the direction that impact gave to my ever-evolving journey.
This early dive into technology wasn't without its challenges. There were countless late nights, debugging sessions that seemed endless, and moments of frustration where I felt like giving up. But through it all, that initial spark of curiosity, fueled by a growing passion, kept me going. It was a trade-off. While my peers were gaining instagram followers, hanging on birthday parties, I was fueling my passion of building something. That was the cost. But I wouldn't trade it for anything.
That foundation, built on self-directed learning and a thirst for knowledge, propelled me forward. In fact, a year after I started learning Cross platform mobile app development (Flutter), when I was in 10th grade, I had the incredible opportunity to be a keynote speaker at Google Developer Groups (GDG) at UPES, Dehradun, delivering a session on "Flutter Hands-On." Imagine that: a high school student, teaching college-level audiences about a technology I'd only just begun to explore myself an year ago! It was a moment that solidified for me the power of actively sharing what you learn and the ripple effect that curiosity can have.
During lockdown, many college’s and IIT’s Techfests were hosted online. I participated in many of them – 19 of them, to be exact. And the result was 11 wins, some even with cash awards. It wasn't just about winning, though the recognition was certainly a boost. It was about the process, the learning, the collaboration, and the sheer thrill of pitting my skills against some of the brightest young minds in the country. I had over-all 9th position in IIT Madras Shaastra Juniors in 2020. I secured 7th position in a case study competition at IIT Bombay Techfest. I had 1st position in IIT Guwahati case study competition. I connected with mentors across IITs and college’s during my school years. The guidance they provided and inspiration i got from those seniors was to a whole another level for me at that time.
And then came another avenue for sharing that passion: my YouTube channel. I started it with the simple goal of teaching python to my peers, since it was in our coursework during 9th and 10th grade. Later I also posted Flutter tutorials there. It wasn't about going viral; it was about creating content that I believed in, content that I hoped would resonate with others who shared my interests. And slowly, organically, it grew to over 2000 subscribers, all based on the strength of the content itself. That taught me the power of authenticity and the importance of contributing to a community.

The IIT Chapter: Beyond the Textbook
Now, you might think getting into IIT would be the "finish line." But for me, it was just a new starting block, another opportunity for that relentless curiosity to take hold. In my very first year at IIT Mandi, I quickly recognized the critical need for cybersecurity in our increasingly digital world. It wasn't just an interesting topic; it felt like a responsibility. So, I dug in, earning my Google Certificate in Cybersecurity.
This wasn't just about getting a certificate; it was about understanding a fundamental aspect of modern technology and how to make a tangible impact. And that commitment paid off: I was selected for the institute's Cybersecurity Club, where I’ve had the incredible opportunity to work on live problems, applying what I’ve learned to real-world challenges. Imagine, just a few months into college, being part of a team actively protecting digital assets. That's the power of pursuing what truly interests you.
But my first year wasn't just about diving deeper into tech. It was also about building connections and making a tangible impact. To network with industry professionals and make a real difference to the IIT Mandi annual tech fest, I opted to join the sponsorship team. It was a different kind of challenge, requiring a blend of communication, persuasion, and teamwork. And I’m proud to say that, with our collective effort, our team generated the highest sponsorship in the history of any fest in IIT Mandi. It showed me that passion isn't just about coding; it's about connecting, collaborating, and making things happen. These were just a few of the many achievements from my first year, each one a testament to staying curious and seizing opportunities.

Your Compass for the Future
So, to all of you, the next generation of innovators, creators, and leaders: find your spark. Nurture your curiosity. Don't be afraid to dive deep, to make mistakes, to reach out, and to carve your own path. The world needs your unique passions and your bold ideas. Go out there, explore the uncharted, and build something amazing.
Thank you.
