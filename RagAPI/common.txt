[03/06/25, 10:14:50 PM] Sachit Bansal: CS prespectice se you can research on Robo Ai  specialisation pehle to
[03/06/25, 10:15:12 PM] Sachit Bansal: Apart from that as fas as i know CS prespective its more self learning thing
[03/06/25, 10:15:33 PM] ~ Navneet: Okay got it thank you
[03/06/25, 10:15:40 PM] Sachit Bansal: Because college courses are mostly theory and then real coding and stuff people study on courses and yt only
[03/06/25, 10:15:46 PM] Vidhi Chandak: Also Open Specialisation is also there , You can study according to your own choice
[03/06/25, 10:16:00 PM] ~ Navneet: Got it
[03/06/25, 10:16:34 PM] ~ Navneet: How is the placement. Can GE guys sit in IT placements?
[03/06/25, 10:16:45 PM] Sachit Bansal: Yea i am inclined towards it since i myself am into CS things
[03/06/25, 10:17:05 PM] Sachit Bansal: @916260553385 @916363670952
[03/06/25, 10:19:45 PM] Vidhi Chandak: Well Most of the companies allow all the branches to sit in placements , I think you can find this data online . And as GE is a new branch we don't have any placement stats as of now so we are unaware too ‎<This message was edited>

[03/06/25, 10:56:28 PM] Piyush Roy: Tumhara robotics specialisation 3rd year seh start hoga
[03/06/25, 10:57:05 PM] Anish Kumar: And till then you'll be laying your foundations things are not easy as though
[03/06/25, 10:59:21 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: 4282 HAI OBC NCL KI
[03/06/25, 10:59:45 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: mtlb bhai
[03/06/25, 11:03:07 PM] Anish Kumar: Se everything works in flow you have reach one step every sem like maths teach in first year let's say differential equations and matrix laid the foundations for your electrical and ai stuff 

And further helps in understanding your specialisation ai robotics 

However you can start learning basics like our robotronics club launches several projects and sessions.
[03/06/25, 11:03:57 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: bhaiya 1 and 2 year ke major subjects
[03/06/25, 11:04:15 PM] Sachit Bansal: Brochure padhle bhai
[03/06/25, 11:04:18 PM] Anish Kumar: Check brochure
[03/06/25, 11:04:44 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ok bro
[03/06/25, 11:06:31 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: bhaiya isme placements ka kya seen hai , how much can we expect from this
[03/06/25, 11:07:14 PM] Anish Kumar: @916363670952
[03/06/25, 11:08:05 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: kis ke number hai bhaiya
[03/06/25, 11:08:47 PM] Anish Kumar: Why are you so confused ?? 

What other options are you having like what are you getting in other iits as past two three years cutoff
[03/06/25, 11:09:39 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: bhaiya in other iits mostly i get chemical , civil , ceramic , mechanical etc
[03/06/25, 11:09:53 PM] Anish Kumar: Which iits
[03/06/25, 11:09:59 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: but i want to pursue my carrier in ai and robotics
[03/06/25, 11:10:04 PM] Anish Kumar: Mostly gen 2 I guess
[03/06/25, 11:10:25 PM] Anish Kumar: Then I must say best option is general engineering
[03/06/25, 11:10:40 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: iit jodhpur , patna , goa , tirupati , palakkad , ropar , etc
[03/06/25, 11:10:40 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Toh fir confusion kis baat ki hai
General engineering lelo
[03/06/25, 11:10:56 PM] Anish Kumar: They are gen 2 and gen 3 only
[03/06/25, 11:11:17 PM] Vidhi Chandak: And Jab General Engineering me Robotics AI ki specialisation hai which is your specific interest then phir kya dikkat
[03/06/25, 11:11:56 PM] Anish Kumar: You are getting this chance as we are the first among all iits including gen 1 to have this specialisation in btech
[03/06/25, 11:12:01 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: bhaiya isme 2 year ke baad cgpi ka to koi chakkar nhi hai na ki cgpi high honi chaiye for robotics and ai ke liye
[03/06/25, 11:12:54 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ha bhaiya ye to hai
[03/06/25, 11:13:21 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Nhi abhi tak toh nhi hai
[03/06/25, 11:13:21 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: new branch hai na isliye
[03/06/25, 11:13:46 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ok . aap abhi konsi year me ho
[03/06/25, 11:14:13 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Second year
[03/06/25, 11:14:30 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: okk then how is your experience
[03/06/25, 11:14:39 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: is it worth it
[03/06/25, 11:14:56 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Totally worth it man
[03/06/25, 11:15:04 PM] Anish Kumar: Nhi hoga main agenda of the branch ki tum apna interest pursue karo like hamari branch mein 28 log hain and there is no caps koi bhi koi si specialisation le skta hain and you will find same in your batch ki sab robo ai nhi lenge some will move onto finance and mechatronics and communication and open 

And as ye btech nhi hain iit mandi ke ander toh students bhi limited honge so they can intake  around 50-70 ig and whole branch size is just 30 
So koi criteria nhi haib
[03/06/25, 11:15:53 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: bhaiya ek doubt or hai ki iit mandi specialistion in ai and robotics me or other iits ke ai me frak kya hai
[03/06/25, 11:16:24 PM] Anish Kumar: You will explore robotics perspects in fields of ai
[03/06/25, 11:16:58 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Jaha tak mere ko pta hai baaki iits mei ai and ds mei BTech hoti hai aur yaha ai and robotics mei hai
[03/06/25, 11:17:27 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Aur yeh baat toh hai hi
[03/06/25, 11:17:33 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: bhaiya lekin ye itne piche rank tak kyu milti hai
[03/06/25, 11:18:12 PM] Vidhi Chandak: bcz new branch hai , Jyada popular nahi h for now and ye specialisations bahut recently add huwe hai isliye .
[03/06/25, 11:19:43 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Kyunki pichle saal tak koi clear course structure nhi tha par ab saara curriculum for all specializations bn gya hai
[03/06/25, 11:20:15 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ok than can i get this with 4282 rank obc ncl
[03/06/25, 11:20:24 PM] Anish Kumar: Because people were in 2nd year and they designed their curriculum
[03/06/25, 11:20:31 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: pichle saal 4693 tha cutoff
[03/06/25, 11:20:55 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Iska koi idea nhi hai kyunki iss saal cutoff uper jaane ke poore chances hai
[03/06/25, 11:21:11 PM] Anish Kumar: We have opening rank of 7000 general category and closing somewhere around 10800
[03/06/25, 11:21:35 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ok
[03/06/25, 11:21:51 PM] Anish Kumar: That ig is not bad
[03/06/25, 11:22:24 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ig ??
[03/06/25, 11:22:29 PM] Anish Kumar: I guess
[03/06/25, 11:23:50 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: so can i get this branch
[03/06/25, 11:23:57 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: any possibility
[03/06/25, 11:24:12 PM] Vidhi Chandak: Mock round me pata chal jayega
[03/06/25, 11:24:24 PM] Sachit Bansal: Yea
[03/06/25, 11:24:45 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ok
[03/06/25, 11:38:38 PM] Akshat Jha: guys @A is me, Akshat Jha, Robotics and AI 3rd year, 


wrt placements since we didnt have our own internship drive yet,  all i can say is it honestly depends on the company as Piyush Roy told, ie, a strong communicator needs to be there in general engineering (ek toh hoga hi (in 30ppl) toh chinta mat karo) who can convince the hiring team of companies to let our branch sit for that (uske aage depends on ur skills to crack the company based on its hiring procedure)
[03/06/25, 11:39:50 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: hmm bhaiya

[04/06/25, 1:53:12 PM] ~ Avi: Let's say ki mujhe finance wale field mei interest hai and I do a specialization in that field, but do like good finance firms like jpmc and all visit the college for placements and summer internships, and kya other branches se mei thora advantage mei rahunga
[04/06/25, 1:53:43 PM] Sachit Bansal: @916260553385 @916363670952
[04/06/25, 1:54:26 PM] Sachit Bansal: Other branches ke to bohot advantage mein rahoge
[04/06/25, 1:54:31 PM] Sachit Bansal: And considerably other iits ke bhi
[04/06/25, 1:54:43 PM] Sachit Bansal: Because kisi iit mein particularly btech mein quant nahi padhare hain
[04/06/25, 1:54:51 PM] Sachit Bansal: To subject knowledge strong hogi tumhari bohot
[04/06/25, 1:54:52 PM] Vitthal Seth: Specific companies ka nahi keh skte but ofc agr tumhare domain ke liye companies attract kr paye toh obv priority bhi tumhe hi milegi , kyuki koi bhi btech branch iske aas paas ka bhi kuch cover ni krti
[04/06/25, 1:56:42 PM] Sachit Bansal: And mostly its not about company visintinf the campus. Tum 4 saal campus mein hoge so you build connections accross this domain with peers seniors and proffs to network bhi waisa build hoke tum companies ko khud se bhi approach kr paoge. Proffs ke bhi tons of references hote hain to help out
[04/06/25, 1:57:18 PM] Sachit Bansal: Point is ki at the end of the day agar subject knowledge achhi hai to company coming to campus or not coming with not be a significant problem
[04/06/25, 1:57:22 PM] ~ Avi: Haa understandable. But should I prefer this over bits msc chem/phy. Cuz waha bhi finance minor ka option hota hai second year se and I'm sure these companies come over there, I talked to a senior over there.
[04/06/25, 1:58:03 PM] ~ Avi: I see
[04/06/25, 1:58:10 PM] Sachit Bansal: Udhar tum minor karoge. Idhar specialisation with IIT Tag
[04/06/25, 1:59:10 PM] Sachit Bansal: And then bits vs iit mein again whole another debate of culture opportunities inter iit networking and stuff aa jata
[04/06/25, 1:59:29 PM] ~ Avi: Haan baat toh sahi hai. But bits ka alumni network is more vast and established than IIT mandi right. So tabhi mai soch raha tha
[04/06/25, 1:59:49 PM] Sachit Bansal: Hn that is one point with bits cant deny
[04/06/25, 2:00:17 PM] Sachit Bansal: You see its not iit mandi network
[04/06/25, 2:00:21 PM] Sachit Bansal: Its IIT network
[04/06/25, 2:00:48 PM] Sachit Bansal: So bits network cant be stronger than iit network i believe
[04/06/25, 2:00:57 PM] Sachit Bansal: And you wont be limited to iit mandi ever
[04/06/25, 2:01:13 PM] Sachit Bansal: I have friends in roorkee delhi kgp ropar
[04/06/25, 2:01:26 PM] Sachit Bansal: Through their reference i have access to their alumni and proffs
[04/06/25, 2:01:33 PM] Sachit Bansal: Common connect ki baat hoti hai
[04/06/25, 2:05:34 PM] ~ Avi: Haan woh toh hai, iit sunte he respect ++. I talked to one bits waale bhaiya and he was laughing like mandi kaun jata hai bits chorke. Bits ke seniors are very biased bout their college ngl. Aur thora sochna parega iske baare mei. Cuz I want the IIT tag but since it's a new course so thora dicey hai mamla.
[04/06/25, 2:05:59 PM] Sachit Bansal: Bro understand one thing
[04/06/25, 2:06:14 PM] Sachit Bansal: Tumhe iit ka real tag 10 years baad kaam aayega
[04/06/25, 2:06:21 PM] Sachit Bansal: Tab tak mandi will be far better
[04/06/25, 2:06:26 PM] Sachit Bansal: And to be very honest
[04/06/25, 2:06:47 PM] Sachit Bansal: Last 2 years mein bohot grow hua hai mandi. Uska tech cultre and student body has massively progressed
[04/06/25, 2:07:16 PM] Sachit Bansal: Ye effect 4th year tak propogate hone mein 2 saal hain. Uske baad india ko dikhega. But we know internally kitne opportunities nikalre hain
[04/06/25, 2:07:37 PM] Sachit Bansal: Plus as far as tumhe opps milre and growth hori hai and complimentrt iit tag hai
[04/06/25, 2:07:40 PM] Sachit Bansal: Kya dikkat hai
[04/06/25, 2:07:58 PM] Sachit Bansal: Bete chhuttiyon mein school jaake teachers se milna iit ki tshir pehnke
[04/06/25, 2:08:13 PM] Sachit Bansal: 10-11th ke bacccheee puchhte hain “bhaiya kaise crack kara”
[04/06/25, 2:08:21 PM] Sachit Bansal: Bits ke liue ni puchhenge
[04/06/25, 2:08:24 PM] Sachit Bansal: Goal sabka iit hota hai
[04/06/25, 2:08:26 PM] Sachit Bansal: Bits nahi
[04/06/25, 2:08:36 PM] Sachit Bansal: Iit na milne pe bits ko achha bolke udhar jaate hain log
[04/06/25, 2:11:31 PM] ~ Avi: Haan yeh toh sach bol diya aapne. Haan like I agree prep start Kari thi 11th mei with the mindset ki IIT mei jaana hai. Ab agar bits chala jau toh ek cheez reh jayegi. Emotional point of view se toh IIT mandi he clear winner hai. Logically bhi yahi sahi decision lag raha hai.

Agar finance meh jana hai pehle kisi basic trading firm/asset management meh jana hoga jo india based hai then you can go further and go for Tower reasearch and Quadeye and then jpmc jaise giants meh mauka milega

[04/06/25, 2:39:32 PM] ~ Avi: That's why I was preferring bits in this scenario, cuz I've heard there's this thing called practice school. So jpmc and some other finance firms come there. Aur mostly cgpa and fin minor ke basis pe bacche uthate he for internships. waha se so it's a simpler route I beleive. What's ur opinion on this
[04/06/25, 2:40:38 PM] Piyush Roy: Tumhe bits meh kaunsi branch mil rahi hai?
[04/06/25, 2:41:26 PM] ~ Avi: 272 aya hai, so borderline of circuital. Msc is sureshot.
[04/06/25, 2:43:20 PM] Piyush Roy: See badi firms pehle high college then high branches and then high iq walo ko prefer karte hai 


Soo it's on you to decide ki tum bits meh stand kar paoge ya nahi
[04/06/25, 2:44:13 PM] Piyush Roy: And secondly the fee at bits is also too high. Tho baad meh voh cheez worth it rahegi ya nahi yeh bhi soachna
[04/06/25, 2:47:53 PM] Sachit Bansal: Plus
[04/06/25, 2:49:24 PM] ~ Avi: Haan I see, Itna effort diya nahi tha jee pe honestly. Ab toh college pe jaake he I'll know where do I stand. But I just wanna make sure I'm not taking the wrong decision taaki baad mei Jake regrets na ho

[04/06/25, 2:51:54 PM] ~ Tahir: Or bits
[04/06/25, 3:17:02 PM] Piyush Roy: Msc - Material science??
[04/06/25, 3:18:45 PM] Piyush Roy: Coz culture acha hai waha par 

Finance/ quant/ counsultancy meh order of college essa hai 

Tier 1 iit > Bits Pilani campus > tier 2 iit and bits other campus> 0 in other Colleges
[04/06/25, 3:21:24 PM] Piyush Roy: Tbvh, agar fees issue nahi hai and bits meh tumhe non circuital seh satisfied ho tho go with bits 👍🏻
[04/06/25, 3:22:33 PM] ~ Tahir: Dual degree is msc
[04/06/25, 3:22:38 PM] ~ Avi: Msc mean masters in basic sciences like phy, chem etc. Fir at the end of second year we get our desired branch on the basis of cgpa. 8+ for cs and 7+ for circuital and so on
[04/06/25, 3:22:54 PM] ~ Tahir: 4 yrs btech + 1 yr u get masters

Like we can opt for any specialization without any restriction, like for example if we choose specialisation in robotics and ai do we get equal opportunities as a normal student who is doing his btech from any IIT in AI?

2 - IIT BHU - CERAMIC → as i have researched... it is very chill and so i will be able to focus more on other skills to perform good in non core placements as well

[05/06/25, 12:10:29 PM] ~ Abhinav Sharma: 2) ki general engg main sare courses ke basic padhaye jayege toh aisa toh nahi h ki sara time academics main lag jaye matlab relatively tough branch h ya chill
[05/06/25, 12:10:33 PM] Piyush Roy: Actually if you pay at IIT Mandi then aapko degree sirf IIT Mandi ki milti hai usmeh likha rahega ki Btech in general engineering with specialization in abc from Dalarna university 

But agar tumhe Dalarna ka bhi certification chahiye tho waha ki fee bharni hogi
[05/06/25, 12:11:45 PM] Sachit Bansal: First 2 years mein sem 4 is little heavy. Rest is chill
[05/06/25, 12:12:02 PM] Sachit Bansal: Because then uske baad sab kuchh nahi padhna hai
[05/06/25, 12:13:15 PM] ~ Abhinav Sharma: toh agar koi jaye udhar padhne par degree mandi ki hi le toh fees mandi ki hi lagegi dalarna ki nahi

[05/06/25, 12:17:11 PM] ~ Abhinav Sharma: kyuki companies toh specific post ke liye aati hogi

[05/06/25, 12:26:47 PM] Sachit Bansal: And sem 4 se you will start doing spl ke courses already
[05/06/25, 12:26:49 PM] Vidhi Chandak: First of all , Jab kisi company ke interview me jaate ho toh they don't expect you to know everything about the field , Ofc training period hota hai and usme aapko sikhaya jata hai about the post you will be getting 

secondly if you are clr about what u want to do or what specific post you want in a company , Then i think 2 yrs will be sufficient and ofc Cllg courses doesn't matter that much , Your own side by side efforts will matter the most
[05/06/25, 12:26:54 PM] Sachit Bansal: To delta utna badha nahi hai

[05/06/25, 1:17:58 PM] Sachit Bansal: Bhai considering ki branch aage jaake devide hogi to koi particular proff hai ni GE ke
[05/06/25, 1:18:09 PM] Sachit Bansal: But in general mostly proff mandi ke achhe hain supporting hai
[05/06/25, 1:18:17 PM] Sachit Bansal: Baaki padhai ke maamle mein idk
[05/06/25, 1:18:59 PM] Vitthal Seth: See bhot slim possibility hai GE milne ki so assume you are not getting it (mtlb order mei uper daal dena pr maan ke chalo nahi hi mil rhi hai), phir apna naya ek safe , sure shot option dekho , kyuki mp wahi milega , zyada cutoffs change nahi honge iss saal bhi opening closing ke , toh GE ko bas rkh uper priority mei mil gya toh miracle , wrna jo sure shot tha woh toh mil hi jaye

Baaki keh baare meh nahi bolunga
[05/06/25, 1:23:44 PM] Vitthal Seth: dekho wahi baat hai thoda ceramic engg ka dekho online , agr tu course jhel lega (hate ni krra ) , toh bhu lelo , although placements ka core mei koi khas ummed mat rkh , lekin agr fall back accha rkhna hai , side ki cheezein itte bhadiya nahi bhi hui toh engg phy patna se core mei kuchh toh mil hi jaega

[06/06/25, 1:21:38 AM] ~ Arpit: Bhaiya i want to know like What do u think about how much SDE related role(tech) companies/ finance companies will allow GE graduate to sit for placements?( Out of 10 companies let say) and will it be  comparable/ higher/lower to mech engineering people? ( As i'm also getting mandi mechanical)
[06/06/25, 1:22:06 AM] ~ GAURAV SINGH: ha bhaiya usme core oppo kam lg rhi thi
[06/06/25, 1:22:10 AM] Sachit Bansal: mech se zyada preference milegi due to robo ai

[06/06/25, 1:24:20 AM] Vitthal Seth: You always can , if you have more domain knowledge than any other , no discrimination on the basis of branch!
[06/06/25, 1:24:36 AM] Vitthal Seth: That is for sure!

[06/06/25, 1:27:53 AM] Vidhi Chandak: Vaise Most of the companies allow all the students to sit in placements and uske baad what matters is your skillset .
Toh you will see it very less in iits ki only some specific branch ke students are allowed to sit for specific roles .

[06/06/25, 1:41:51 AM] Piyush Roy: Emotional mat hua karo answer karte hue
See company par depend karega ki voh allow kare ya na kare, hamare liye kare and fir next time tumhare batch keh liye na kare 
Saari cheezen company policy hai.
We try ki karde but at the end its on company. 

DONT EXPECT THAT software companies BAITHNE HI DENGI, its tough and accept

But apart from software there are companies jo tumhe equivalent placement de and tum waha career bana sako. Hamare yaha robotics ki companies aati hai jo HDFC, Samsung, startups, infact amazon seh bhi jyada stipend deti hai soo usmeh career banao.

[06/06/25, 12:03:22 PM] ~ Sahil Choudhary: According to brochure it looks good
[06/06/25, 12:04:01 PM] ~ Sahil Choudhary: But if you are in this then how is this branch, how can the placement wage be, what is its scene
[06/06/25, 12:05:41 PM] ~ Jatin: What companies came there for internship, and what is the intern stats for this branch ?How much is workload ? And can we get enough time for sd preparation side by side?
[06/06/25, 12:27:39 PM] Piyush Roy: When we are saying to read the FAQ then read it at least.
[06/06/25, 12:28:51 PM] Piyush Roy: Placement opportunities bhi achi hai, you can go for robotics, finance, data stats, mech, ev, electrical( if allowed by companies )

[06/06/25, 1:26:04 PM] Ritvik Garg: Yes, if the courses which are part of your specialisation are CSE courses, then you will be taught by the same professors as CSE people
[06/06/25, 1:28:03 PM] Ritvik Garg: I am not sure whether major + minor degree exists here....what I am sure about is that every branch allows you to take elective courses in the 3rd and 4th years
These elective courses are generally interdisciplinary, meaning you can study in courses from other branches as well
[06/06/25, 1:30:00 PM] ~ student'25: If I do open specialisation in something, it won't be considered as minor, right?  Also can I choose like whole course duplicate of cse students in third and fourth year  in my open specialisation curriculum, is there any restrictions?
[06/06/25, 1:31:40 PM] Ritvik Garg: No no, that is not a minor degree...if you read the brochure carefully, it says that the degree awarded will be "btech in general engineering" instead of "btech in general engineering with specialization in ABC"
However, since this is a new branch, we can consider the option of converting open specialisation to a minor degree 
But for now, there is no provision for minor degree
[06/06/25, 1:32:15 PM] Ritvik Garg: No, you can't duplicate the entire course of CSE
There are restrictions, like you can't choose all your electives as only CSE courses
[06/06/25, 1:34:34 PM] ~ student'25: Can you clarify it more, how many electives we can choose, what are the restrictions..... I don't understand this part
[06/06/25, 1:52:17 PM] Ritvik Garg: The restriction is that "the combination of the elective courses is less than 40% of the discipline core courses of a specific branch"
I'll explain with an example....so suppose CSE students have 3 core courses A, B, C 
40% of 3 is 1.2...this means that you only get to choose 1 core course of CSE
Moreover, you can't just choose any one out of A, B or C....it may be that the professor taking course C doesn't allow you to sit in that course (maybe because you haven't done some prerequisites for that course), so you can't choose course C ‎<This message was edited>
[06/06/25, 1:54:50 PM] Ritvik Garg: In open specialisation, you get to do elective courses of 52 credits 
I don't know if you'll get what that means, but the takeaway point for you is youll get to study more elective courses in open specialisation than other specialisations ‎<This message was edited>
[06/06/25, 1:56:53 PM] ~ student'25: Are there any core courses that you must have to take in third or fourth year in general engineering
[06/06/25, 1:58:06 PM] Ritvik Garg: Yes...I think 1-2 are common irrespective of your specialisation and then you obviously have core courses relevant to your specialisation 
@916260553385 bhaiya can answer this one better, hes in third year ‎<This message was edited>

And then I have to take my electives so, If I want to get in hardware then I will be taking hardware one and if I want to get into software then I will take courses for software

I m also considering mandi civil as well but since ge is new branch but has better cutoff , i m confused which one should be good for me.. pls help should I keep ge over civil? Because civil i will get most probably
[06/06/25, 2:44:58 PM] ~ Arpit Agarwal: And is the reason for better cutoff for this branch because of specialization it allows in robotics and ai?

[06/06/25, 5:08:40 PM] ~ Saashi Gupta: If I am right, one has to be a rather decisive person to be in this branch and be clear about what they want, either early on or after 1st year?

[06/06/25, 5:30:11 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Ha bhaiya
[06/06/25, 5:30:54 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Ye Sweden wali university Mai gye to fir fees IIT mandi wali hogi Ki unka fees structure ke hisab se
[06/06/25, 5:33:49 PM] Anish Kumar: Sweden mein only they will cover your teaching expenses 

Rest cost of living you will need to invest 
 
Apart from that if you want degree of Sweden university of what courses you did there you have to pay some amount

[06/06/25, 5:40:31 PM] Vitthal Seth: Hmm @918847005206 so double major is there but gen engg is quite hectic in 3rd and 4th year so
[06/06/25, 5:41:00 PM] Vitthal Seth: Idk if you can manage , altho i you choose the specialisation based on your interest courses would be smoother!
[06/06/25, 5:41:36 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Bhaiya ye industrial partner ship Mai Kya raheta hai ‎<This message was edited>

[06/06/25, 5:42:59 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Milegi?
[06/06/25, 5:43:08 PM] Vitthal Seth: Minimising the adjustment period from college kid to a full time employee ready for the industry
[06/06/25, 5:43:34 PM] Vitthal Seth: Haaaan that all internship time would be counted , since they will teach you there ways there!

[06/06/25, 5:45:10 PM] Vitthal Seth: Btech in general engg and specialisation in XYZ
[06/06/25, 5:45:32 PM] ~ Nihal.25: But as intern Mai thodi fir specialisation karunga esliye
[06/06/25, 5:45:51 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Ya fir dono sath Mai hota Hai?
[06/06/25, 5:46:06 PM] Vitthal Seth: Whi naa as a intern seekhogee !
[06/06/25, 5:47:21 PM] Piyush Roy: Kehna yeh chah rahe hai ki for eg tum specialisation karte tho bentley keh sath, voh mainly industrial automation par kaam karti hai tho essa kuch likha ayega 

Btech in GE with specialisation in industrial automation with Bentley
[06/06/25, 5:48:06 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Ok understood 
Thank you Bhaiya
[06/06/25, 5:57:30 PM] ~ sinha: How is the overall experience with specialisation in general engineering?

[06/06/25, 5:59:34 PM] Vitthal Seth: Fairly good , we all very optimistic abt the branch ,(since seniors and us designed it)
[06/06/25, 6:00:00 PM] Vitthal Seth: Do you have any doubts? That is a very general ques to ask tbh!
[06/06/25, 6:00:20 PM] Vitthal Seth: Specialisations will start this coming sem
[06/06/25, 6:00:37 PM] Vitthal Seth: For our seniors , so no first hand experience
[06/06/25, 6:00:40 PM] ~ sinha: Like how many specialisations are confirmed till now?
[06/06/25, 6:00:56 PM] Vitthal Seth: B R O U C H U R E

[06/06/25, 6:01:45 PM] ~ sinha: 5 were shown but I just wanted to confirm from seniors😅
[06/06/25, 6:02:19 PM] Vitthal Seth: Yeah so 5 ARE! (We made the brochure ourselves bro)
[06/06/25, 6:02:42 PM] Vitthal Seth: And some may be inducted in the future if substantial interest is shown
[06/06/25, 6:03:51 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Okay bhai
[06/06/25, 6:05:45 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Bhaiya i have no particular instrust
[06/06/25, 6:05:53 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Intrust*
[06/06/25, 6:06:05 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: I am really confused between
[06/06/25, 6:06:28 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: BS kanpur earth science/ BS chemistry or general eng at mandi
[06/06/25, 6:06:40 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Apne brochure bhi pdha
[06/06/25, 6:06:45 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Jayada kuch idea lga nhi
[06/06/25, 6:07:04 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Kanpur isliye becz usme thoda bhot branch change ka bhi chance
[06/06/25, 6:07:05 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Hai
[06/06/25, 6:07:17 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: But seniors said dnt join because of branch change
[06/06/25, 6:07:51 PM] Vitthal Seth: See one is FULL research and you might do Masters and higher studies to make it worth it , other is making you industry ready , some of the most innovative courses and specialisations
[06/06/25, 6:08:03 PM] Vitthal Seth: Exactly!
[06/06/25, 6:08:37 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Because in kanpur you'll get a lot of competition for branch change
[06/06/25, 6:08:41 PM] Vitthal Seth: Batao na , rough picture mili?
[06/06/25, 6:08:48 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Ek iit delhi biotech wale senior se baat kri kehta agar iit hi ana h aur lowest branch mil rhi h to top 5 me hi ana
[06/06/25, 6:09:11 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Exactly bhaiya
[06/06/25, 6:09:34 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Lekin agar gate or cat bhi further ka plan hua to kanpur shi h
[06/06/25, 6:09:34 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: ?
[06/06/25, 6:10:02 PM] Vitthal Seth: Haaan pr lower does not promise you anything , most of the things the dependent of your calibre , how much you can do on the side
[06/06/25, 6:10:08 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Yeh tumhare upar hai ab  hmmare pass bhi yeh option thi but we made our choice ourselves.
[06/06/25, 6:10:46 PM] Vitthal Seth: Haaaan mostly if you want higher studies , kanpur research is quite useful !
[06/06/25, 6:11:30 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: And u are happy
[06/06/25, 6:11:36 PM] Vitthal Seth: Try to make contact with seniors of these lower branches in top5’s then you will get a clearer picture
[06/06/25, 6:11:36 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: After that bhaiya
[06/06/25, 6:11:38 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: ?
[06/06/25, 6:11:49 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: I have made
[06/06/25, 6:12:06 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: But there are very less seniors i am finding in this branch
[06/06/25, 6:12:10 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: On linkedin insta
[06/06/25, 6:12:13 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Etc
[06/06/25, 6:13:20 PM] Vitthal Seth: Bhayy people are kaafi optimistic abt the branch , kyuki all the specialisations are industry specifics and one of their kind ! ROBO AI as a degree is NOT offered in ANY IIT , so clear advantage
[06/06/25, 6:13:33 PM] Vitthal Seth: For companies like schrodinger and seimens

[06/06/25, 6:17:23 PM] Vitthal Seth: ➕➕➕➕➕
[06/06/25, 6:18:06 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Bhaiya would there be any CPI criteria for specialisation
[06/06/25, 6:18:20 PM] Vitthal Seth: You mean CGPA?
[06/06/25, 6:18:28 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Ha
[06/06/25, 6:18:58 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Naah till now there is no cap on the number of students that can take a particular specialisation
[06/06/25, 6:19:10 PM] Vitthal Seth: No cap, for choosing a specialisation there is no requirement of CGPA or anything
[06/06/25, 6:19:17 PM] Vitthal Seth: It is free to choose for all
[06/06/25, 6:19:25 PM] ~ Nihal.25: In future mtlb hamre time PE lagega?
[06/06/25, 6:19:54 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Nhi kyunki tumhare batch ki strength bhi same hi rhegi jo hmari hai ‎<This message was edited>

[06/06/25, 8:30:37 PM] ~ 😃: In general engineering placement does people get job of general engineering or they learn coding side by side and get job in software company? Like people in IIT mandi biochemical branch learn coding and get placement is this same with general engineering or not ?
[06/06/25, 8:35:05 PM] Ritvik Garg: That depends on you....I mean if you have taken Fintech specialisation suppose, and then you're also prepping your software skills for a software job, then it's possible you can land a job in either domain
But if this was your motive, why did you join general engineering in the first place? See this branch is all about removing this rigidity which exists in the system....it removes the problem of "I'm stuck with biotech but I wanted to go in cs domain"....here, you dont have to do coding on the side when you can do coding in the main
[06/06/25, 8:43:31 PM] ~ 😃: If everybody want  to join artificial intelligence course after 2 year will they allow it to join everyone or there is any limit how many people can join in a particular branch?
[06/06/25, 8:51:26 PM] Ritvik Garg: No theres no limit, that's because everyone won't want to join AI specialisation
[06/06/25, 8:51:50 PM] ~ 😃: Ok
[06/06/25, 8:57:05 PM] Sachit Bansal: Abhi tumko Robo Ai bohot fascinate kr ra hai that so tumlo lagra hai sab log wahi lenge. College aake when you will explore then you will realise ki baari specialisation bhi demand and scope ke according leke aayi gyi hain
[06/06/25, 9:00:01 PM] Ritvik Garg: Plus robo, AI mein courses tough rehte hai kaafi...cgpa maintain rakhna mushkil hota hai
[06/06/25, 9:00:48 PM] ~ 😃: How many courses choices you have after 2 year?
[06/06/25, 9:02:26 PM] ~ 😃: And I am also getting nit kurukshetra microelectronics and vlsi branch and government is heavily funded it so what should I choose?
